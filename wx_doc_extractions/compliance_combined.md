Markdown To PDF# Compliance program requirements : FINTRAC's compliance guidance 

From: Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) 

This guidance explains the compliance program requirements under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (the Act) and associated Regulations that apply to all reporting entities. 

## 1. What is a compliance program and what are its requirements 

A compliance program is established and implemented by a reporting entity that is intended to ensure its compliance with the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (the Act) and associated Regulations. A compliance program forms the basis for meeting all of your reporting, record keeping, client identification and other know-your-client requirements under the Act and associated Regulations. All reporting entities must establish and implement a compliance program. 

Specifically, all reporting entities must implement the following elements of a compliance program: 

appoint a compliance officer who is responsible for implementing the program develop and apply written compliance policies and procedures that are kept up to date and, in the case of an entity, are approved by a senior officer conduct a risk assessment of your business to assess and document the risk of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence occurring in the course of your activities 

develop and maintain a written, ongoing compliance training program for your employees, agents or mandataries, or other authorized persons institute and document a plan for the ongoing compliance training program and deliver the training (training plan) institute and document a plan for a review of the compliance program for the purpose of testing its effectiveness, and carry out this review every two years at a minimum ( two-year effectiveness review) 

## 2. Who can be a compliance officer and what are their responsibilities 

Depending on the size of your business, you could be the appointed compliance officer, or it could be another individual, such as: 

a senior manager, the owner or the operator of your small business, or someone from a senior level who has direct access to senior management and the board of directors of your large business 

If you are a person rather than an entity, such as a sole proprietor, you can appoint yourself as the compliance officer, or you may choose to appoint someone else to help you implement the compliance program. 

As a best practice, the appointed compliance officer of a larger business should not be directly involved in the receipt, transfer or payment of funds. The appointed compliance officer should also have independent oversight and be able to communicate directly with those parties who make decisions about the business such as senior management or the board of directors. 

Appointing someone to be your compliance officer alone does not fulfil your compliance program requirements. The appointed compliance officer is responsible for implementing all elements of a compliance program. Therefore, a compliance officer needs to: 

have the necessary authority and access to resources in order to implement an effective compliance program and make any desired changes have knowledge of your business's functions and structure have knowledge of your business sector's money laundering, terrorist activity financing and sanctions evasion risks and vulnerabilities as well as money laundering, terrorist activity financing and sanctions evasion trends and typologies understand your business sector's requirements under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (the Act) and associated Regulations 

A compliance officer may delegate certain duties to other employees. For example, the compliance officer of a large business may delegate responsibility to an individual in another office or branch. However, the compliance officer remains responsible for the implementation of the compliance program. 

While the compliance officer is appointed, it is the reporting entity's responsibility to meet its compliance program requirements under the Act and associated Regulations. 

## 3. Compliance policies and procedures requirements 

Your compliance policies and procedures must be: 

written and should be in a form or format that is accessible to its intended audience kept up to date (including changes to legislation or your internal processes, as well as any other changes that would require an update) approved by a senior officer, if you are an entity 

Your policies and procedures should be made available to all those authorized to act on your behalf, including employees, agents and any others that deal with clients, transactions, or other activities. 

Your compliance policies and procedures should cover at minimum the following requirements as applicable to you as a reporting entity: 

compliance program: this includes your requirements to have an appointed compliance officer, a risk assessment, an ongoing compliance training program and plan, and a two-year effectiveness review and plan, which consists of a review of your policies and procedures, risk assessment, and ongoing training program and plan 

know your client: this includes your requirements for verifying client identity, politically exposed persons, heads of international organizations, their family members and close associates, beneficial ownership, and third party determination 

business relationship and ongoing monitoring record keeping 

Transaction reporting travel rule requirements: this includes your requirement to develop and apply written risk-based policies and procedures to help determine whether you should suspend or reject an electronic funds transfer or virtual currency transfer that you receive, and any other follow-up measures, if the transfer does not include the required travel rule information and you are unable to obtain this information through your reasonable measures 

Ministerial directive requirements 

Your compliance policies and procedures should also include the processes and controls you have put in place to meet your requirements, including: 

when the obligation is triggered the information that must be reported, recorded, or considered the procedures you created to ensure that you fulfill a requirement the timelines associated with your requirements and methods of reporting (if applicable) 

Your policies and procedures must also describe the steps you will take for all the obligations that require you to take reasonable measures. For example, when you are required to take reasonable measures to obtain information to include in a report, your policies and procedures must describe the steps you will take, which could include asking the client. 

If your reporting entity sector has an industry association or governing body that has provided you with a generic set of policies and procedures, you must tailor them to your business. 

The level of detail in your compliance policies and procedures will depend on your business's size, structure, and complexity, and degree of exposure to money laundering, terrorist activity financing and sanctions evasion risks. 

## 4. Risk assessment requirements 

Your compliance program must include policies and procedures that you develop and apply to assess your money laundering, terrorist activity financing and sanctions evasion risks in the course of your activities. When assessing and documenting your money laundering, terrorist activity financing and sanctions evasion risks, you must consider the following: 

your clients, business relationships, and correspondent banking relationships including their activity patterns and geographic locations the products, services and delivery channels you offer the geographic location(s) where you conduct your activities if you are a financial entity, life insurance company, or securities dealer, the risks resulting from the activities of an affiliate, if it is also subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act and associated Regulations under these reporting entity sectors, or if it is a foreign affiliate that carries out activities outside Canada that are similar to these sectors the risks resulting from new developments or new technologies you intend to carry out or introduce, before doing so, that may have an impact on your clients, business relationships, products, services or delivery channels, or the geographic location of your activities the applicable risks for your reporting entity sector, detailed in the latest National Risk Assessment of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing in Canada any other relevant factors affecting your business (for example, employee turnover, industry rules and regulations) 

If, at any time, you consider the risk of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence to be high, you must take enhanced measures. 

## 5. Enhanced measures 

Enhanced measures are the additional controls and processes that you have put in place to manage and reduce the risks associated with your high-risk clients and business areas. As part of your compliance program, you must develop and apply written policies and procedures for the enhanced measures that you will take for any money laundering, terrorist activity financing or sanctions evasion risks you identify as high. 

Your policies and procedures for enhanced measures must include: 

the additional steps, based on assessment of the risk, that you will take to verify the identity of a person or entity any other additional steps that you will take to mitigate the risks, including, but not limited to, the additional steps to: ensure client identification information and beneficial ownership information is updated at a frequency that is appropriate to the level of risk conduct ongoing monitoring of business relationships at a frequency that is appropriate to the level of risk 

Enhanced measures to mitigate risk can include: 

obtaining additional information on a client (for example, information from public databases and the internet) obtaining information on the client's source of funds or source of wealth obtaining information on the reasons for attempted or conducted transactions, or any other measures you deem appropriate 

## 6. Training program and plan requirements 

If you have employees, agents or mandataries, or other persons authorized to act on your behalf, you must develop and maintain a written, ongoing compliance training program. Your training program should explain what your employees, agents or mandataries, or other persons authorized to act on your behalf, need to know and understand, including: 

your requirements under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (the Act) and associated Regulations background information on money laundering and terrorist activity financing, such as the definition of money laundering and terrorist activity financing, and methods of money laundering and terrorist activity financing how your business or profession could be vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist activity financing activities (provide indicators and examples) the compliance policies and procedures you have developed to help meet your requirements under the Act and associated Regulations for preventing and detecting money laundering and terrorist activity financing, including your reporting, record keeping and know your client requirements their roles and responsibilities in detecting and deterring money laundering and terrorist activity financing activities, and when dealing with potentially suspicious activities or transactions 

You must institute and document a plan for your ongoing compliance training program and for delivering the training. Your training plan should cover how you will implement your ongoing compliance training program and its delivery. 

This includes documenting the steps you will take to ensure your employees, agents or mandataries, or other persons authorized to act on your behalf receive an appropriate level of training relevant to their duties and position, on an ongoing basis. 

Your training plan should include information on: 

training recipients training topics and materials training methods for delivery training frequency 

Training recipients have contact with clients, such as front-line staff or agents are involved in client transaction activities handle cash, funds, or virtual currency for you, in any way, and are responsible for implementing or overseeing the compliance program, such as the compliance officer, senior management, information technology staff or internal auditors 

### Training topics and material 

Your training plan should outline the topics that will be covered in your training program. It should also include the sources of the training materials that will cover these topics. 

### Training methods for delivery 

Your training plan should describe the training method(s) that you will use to deliver your ongoing compliance training program. 

Training methods could include: 

self-directed learning (where recipients read materials on their own, register for on-line courses or use e-learning materials) information sessions 

face-to-face meetings classroom conferences, and on-the-job training where instruction is provided 

Instructors can be in-house personnel or an external service provider, but they should have knowledge of the Act and associated Regulations. If you decide to use in- house personnel, you may need to hire or allocate staff to provide training. 

If you decide to use an external service provider, you may need to determine whether their services and training content are suitable for your business. You can use 1 or more training methods. The method(s) that you choose may depend on the size of your business and the number of people that need to be trained. 

### Training frequency 

Your training plan should describe the frequency of your training program. Training can be delivered at regular intervals (for example, monthly, semi-annually, annually), when certain events occur (for example, before a new employee deals with clients, after a procedure is changed), or by using a combination of both. 

Your training program and plan should be tailored to your business's size, structure and complexity, and its degree of exposure to money laundering, terrorist activity financing and sanctions evasion risk. For example, if you are a large business, you may decide to provide different types of training to your employees, agents or mandataries, or other persons authorized to act on your behalf based on their specific roles and duties (for example, general or specialized training). This should be explained in your training plan. 

Your training program should also include a record of the training that has been delivered (for example, the date the training took place, a list of the attendees who received the training, the topics that were covered). Training records will help you keep track of the training and assist you in scheduling the next training dates. They will also demonstrate that you are carrying out your training program on an ongoing basis. 

Note: If you are a sole proprietor with no employees, agents or other individuals authorized to act on your behalf, you are not required to have a training program nor are you required to have a training plan in place for yourself. 

## 7. Two-year effectiveness review and plan requirements 

A two-year effectiveness review is an evaluation that must be conducted every 2 years (at a minimum) to test the effectiveness of the elements of your compliance program (policies and procedures, risk assessment, and ongoing training program and plan). You must start your effectiveness review no later than 2 years (24 months) from the start of your previous review. You must also ensure that you have completed your previous review before you start the next review. 

The purpose of an effectiveness review is to determine whether your compliance program has gaps or weaknesses that may prevent your business from effectively detecting and preventing money laundering, terrorist activity financing and sanctions evasion. 

Your effectiveness review will help you determine if: 

your business practices reflect what is written in your compliance program documentation and if you are meeting your requirements under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (the Act) and associated Regulations your risk assessment is effective at identifying and mitigating the money laundering, terrorist activity financing and sanctions evasion risks related to your clients, affiliates (if any), products, services, delivery channels, new developments or technology, and geographic locations where you do business 

The review must be carried out and the results documented by an internal or external auditor, or by yourself if you do not have an auditor. Your review should be conducted by someone who is knowledgeable of your requirements under the Act and associated Regulations. Also, as a best practice, to ensure that your review is impartial, it should not be conducted by someone who is directly involved in your compliance program activities. Regardless of who carries out the review, as a reporting entity it is your responsibility to ensure that the review is conducted (at a minimum) every 2 years and that the review tests the effectiveness of your compliance program. 

You must also institute and document a plan for the two-year effectiveness review of your compliance program. This plan should describe the scope of the review and must include all the elements of your compliance program. The breadth and depth of review for each element may vary depending on factors such as: 

the complexity of your business transaction volumes findings from previous reviews current money laundering, terrorist activity financing and sanctions evasion risks. 

Your plan should not only describe the scope of the review, but it should include the rationale that supports the areas of focus, the time period that will be reviewed, the anticipated evaluation methods and sample sizes. 

The evaluation methods can include, but are not limited to, interviewing staff, sampling records and reviewing documentation. The following are examples of what can be included in your review: 

interviews with those handling transactions to evaluate their knowledge of your policies and procedures and related record keeping, client identification and reporting requirements a review of a sample of your records to assess whether your client identification policies and procedures are being followed a review of your agreements with agents or mandataries, as applicable, as well as a review of a sample of the information that your agents or mandataries referred to in order to verify the identity of persons, to assess whether client identification policies and procedures are being followed a review of transactions to assess whether suspicious transactions were reported to FINTRAC a review of large cash transactions to assess whether they were reported to FINTRAC with accurate information and within the prescribed timelines a review of electronic funds transfers to assess whether reportable transfers were reported to FINTRAC with accurate information and within the prescribed  timelines (applicable to reporting entity sectors that have electronic funds transfer obligations) a review of a sample of your client records to see whether the risk assessment was applied in accordance with your risk assessment process a review of a sample of your client records to see whether the frequency of your ongoing monitoring is adequate and carried out in accordance with the client's risk level assessment 

a review of a sample of high-risk client records to confirm that enhanced mitigation measures were taken a review of a sample of your records to confirm that proper record keeping procedures are being followed a review of your risk assessment to confirm that it reflects your current operations a review of your policies and procedures to ensure that they are up to date and reflect the current legislative requirements and that they reflect your current business practices 

You should also document the following in your two-year effectiveness review: 

the date the review was conducted, the period that was covered by the review and the person or entity who performed the review the results of the tests that were performed 

the conclusions, including deficiencies, recommendations and action plans, if any 

If you are an entity, you must report, in writing, the following to a senior officer no later than 30 days after the completion of the effectiveness review: 

the findings of the review (for example, deficiencies, recommendations, action plans) any updates made to the policies and procedures during the reporting period (the period covered by the two-year review) that were not made as a result of the review itself 

the status of the implementation of the updates made to your policies and procedures 

# Risk assessment guidance 

## Overview 

FINTRAC developed this guidance to help you understand, as a reporting entity (RE): 

the types of money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) risks that you may encounter as a result of your business activities and clients; and what is a risk-based approach (RBA) and how you can use one to conduct a risk assessment of your business activities and clients. 

This guidance also provides tools that you can use to develop and implement mitigation measures to address high-risk areas identified through your risk assessment. You can use these tools or you can develop your own risk assessment tools.This guidance is applicable to all REs subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and associated Regulations. However, some risk assessment obligations and/or examples may only apply to certain sectors. 

As part of your compliance program requirements under the PCMLTFA and associated Regulations, you must conduct a risk assessment of your ML/TF risks.Footnote 1 You are responsible for completing and documenting your own risk assessment. However, FINTRAC does not prescribe how a risk assessment should be conducted. Rather, this guidance explains an internationally recognized way of conducting a risk assessment using an RBA and provides you with other tools that may help you meet your risk assessment obligations. For more information about your risk assessment obligations see FINTRAC's Compliance program requirements guidance. 

## Who is this guidance for 

All reporting entities (REs) 

### 1. What is risk? 

Risk is the likelihood of a negative occurrence or event happening and its consequences. In simple terms, risk is a combination of the chance that something may happen and the degree of damage or loss that may result. In the context of ML/TF, risk means: 

At the national level: Threats and vulnerabilities presented by ML/TF that put the integrity of Canada's financial system at risk, as well as the safety and security of Canadians. For example, organized crime groups operating in Canada that launder the proceeds of crime. 

At the RE level: Internal and external threats and vulnerabilities that could open an RE up to the possibility of being used to facilitate ML/TF activities. For example, a possible ML/TF risk at the RE level could be conducting business with clients located in high-risk jurisdictions or locations of concern. 

Threats: A person, group or object that could cause harm. In the ML/TF context, threats could be criminals, third parties facilitating ML/TF, terrorists or terrorist groups or their funds. 

Vulnerabilities: Elements of a business or its processes that are susceptible to harm and could be exploited by a threat. In the ML/TF context, vulnerabilities could include weak business controls or high-risk products or services. 

### 2. What are inherent and residual risks? 

Inherent risk is the risk of an event or circumstance that exists before you implement controls or mitigation measures.Footnote 2 Whereas residual risk is the level of risk that remains after you have implemented controls or mitigation measures. 

When assessing risk, it is important to distinguish between inherent risk and residual risk. The RBA described in this guidance focuses on the inherent risks to your business, its activities and clients. 

### 3. What is an RBA? 

possible ML/TF risks, and to apply controls and measures to mitigate these risks. 

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), has developed a series of Recommendations that are recognized as the international standard for combating money laundering, terrorism financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. Recommendation 1 on the RBA, recognizes that an RBA is an effective way to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. 

Using an RBA will enable you to: 

conduct a risk assessment of your business activities and clients taking into consideration certain elements, including: 

your products, services and delivery channelsFootnote 3; the geographic location of your activitiesFootnote 4; new developments and technologiesFootnote 5; your clients and business relationshipsFootnote 6; the activities of your foreign and domestic affiliatesFootnote 7 — This only applies to you if you are a financial entity, life insurance company or securities dealer, and the affiliate carries out activities similar to those of a financial entity, life insurance company or securities dealer; and any other relevant factorFootnote 8. 

mitigate the risks you identify through the implementation of controls and measures tailored to these risks, which includes the ongoing monitoring of business relationships for the purpose of: 

keeping client identification information and, if required, beneficial ownership and business relationship information up to date in accordance with the assessed level of risk;Footnote 9 reassessing the level of risk associated with transactions and activities;Footnote 10and applying enhanced or special measures to those transactions and business relationships identified as high-risk.Footnote 11 

identify and assess potential gaps or weaknesses of your compliance program. For example, using an RBA can help you to identify and assess risks that could impact other parts of your compliance program, such as gaps in your written policies, procedures or training program. 

The PCMLTFA and associated Regulations do not prohibit you from having high-risk activities or high-risk business relationships. However, it is important that if you identify high-risk activities or high-risk business relationships that you document and implement appropriate controls to mitigate these risks and apply prescribed special measures. 

It is important to remember that assessing and mitigating the risk of ML/TF is not a static exercise. The risks you identify may change or evolve over time as new products, services, affiliations, or developments and technologies enter your business or its environment. You should be regularly reassessing the ML/TF-related risks to your business, and documenting that assessment to keep it up to date. For example, if you add a new product, service or technology to your business, or open a new location, you should evaluate and document the associated risks of this change to your business. 

### 4. What is the RBA cycle? 

The RBA cycle consists of six steps to follow to complete a risk assessment. The diagram below summarizes the RBA cycle. Additional information on how to conduct each step can be found further below. 

There is no prescribed methodology for the assessment of risks. FINTRAC's suggested model presents business-based and relationship-based risk assessments separately. Although presented separately in this guidance, you can complete business-based and relationship-based assessments simultaneously. You will need to adapt this model to your business should you choose to use it. 

#### RBA cycle — Step 1: Identify your inherent risks of ML/TF 

To identify your inherent risks of ML/TF, you would start by assessing the following areas of your business: 

products, services and delivery channels; geography; 

new developments and technologies; clients and business relationships; activities of foreign and domestic affiliates, if applicable; and any other relevant factors. 

##### Business-based risk assessment 

Begin your risk assessment by looking at your business as a whole. This will allow you to identify where risks occur across business lines, clients or particular products or services. You will need to document mitigation controls for the areas you identify as high-risk.Footnote 12 The number of risks you identify will vary based on the type of business activities you conduct and products and/or services you offer. 

To conduct a business-based risk assessment, you need to identify the inherent risks of your business by assessing your vulnerabilities to ML/TF. Your overall business-based risk assessment includes the risk posed by the following: 

* 1. The combination of your products, services and delivery channels;
* 2. The geographical locations in which your business operates;
* 3. The impact of new developments and technologies that affect your operations;
* 4. The risks that result from affiliates (the activities that they carry out); and
* 5. Other relevant factors. 
	+ 1. Products, services and delivery channels You need to identify the products, services and delivery channels or ways in which they combine that may pose higher risks of ML/TF. Delivery channels are mediums through which you offer products and/or services to clients, or through which you can conduct transactions. See Annex 2 — Table 1: Business-based examples of higher risk indicators and considerations for products, services and delivery channels.
	+ 2. Geography You need to identify the extent to which the geographic locations where you operate or undertake activities could pose a high-risk for ML/TF. Depending on your business and operations, this can range from your immediate surroundings, whether rural or urban, to a province or territory, multiple jurisdictions within Canada (domestic) or other countries. See Annex 2 — Table 2: Business-based examples of higher risk indicators and considerations for geography.
	+ 3. New developments and technologies You need to identify the risks associated with new developments and the adoption of new technologies within your business. That is, if your business intends to put in place a new service/activity/location or introduce a new technology, then you must assess it in order to analyze the potential ML/TF risks it may bring to your business, before you implement it. See Annex 2 — Table 3: Business-based examples of higher risk indicators and considerations for new developments and technologies.
	+ 4. Foreign and domestic affiliates If you are a financial entity, life insurance company or securities dealer, you need to identify the risks associated with having foreign and domestic affiliates, if the affiliate carries out activities similar to those of a financial entity, life insurance company or securities dealer. An entity is your affiliate if one of you is wholly owned by the other, you are both wholly owned by the same entity, or your financial statements are consolidated. See Annex 2 — Table 4: Business-based examples of higher risk indicators and considerations for foreign and domestic affiliates.
	+ 5. Other relevant factors (if applicable): You need to identify other factors relevant to your business and that could have an impact on the risk of ML/TF such as: 
	
	legal: related to domestic laws, regulations and potential threats structural: related to specific business models and processes 
	
	Scoring your business-based risk assessment 
	
	Once you have identified and documented all the inherent risks to your business, you can assign a level or score to each risk using a scale or scoring methodology tailored to the size and type of your business. For example, very small businesses engaged in occasional, straightforward transactions may only require distinguishing between low and high-risk categories. FINTRAC expects larger businesses to establish more sophisticated risk scales or scoring methodologies, which could include additional risk categories. 
	
	By law, you must apply and document special measures for the high-risk elements of your business.Footnote 13 You must also be able to demonstrate to FINTRAC that you have put controls and measures in place to address these high-risk elements (for example, in your policies and procedures or training program), and that they are effective (this could be done through your internal or independent review). See Annex 3 — Table 6: Examples of risk segregation for a business-based risk assessment. 
	
	Additionally, you can use a likelihood and impact matrix tool similar to the one provided in Annex 4, to help you evaluate your business-based risk assessment. 
	
	Business-based risk assessment worksheet 
	
	Using a business-based risk assessment worksheet could be an easy way to document the inherent risks related to your business. The worksheet below is given as an example. You can also develop your own worksheet or method to document the inherent risks related to your business. 
	
	
	
	| Column A: | Column B: | Column C: Rationale Explain why you assigned a particular risk rating to each risk |
	| --- | --- | --- |
	| List of factors Identify all the risk factors that apply to your business (including, products, services and delivery channels, geography, new developments and technologies, foreign and domestic affiliates and other relevant factors) | Risk rating Assess each risk factor (for example, low, medium or high). | factor. |
	| - - High turnover within your business of employees who deal directly withclients. | High-risk | knowledge of certain clients and less experience with ML/TF indicators. |
	| - Proximity to border crossings | High-risk | Your business may be the first point of entry into the local financial system. |
	
	New employees may have less
##### Relationship-based risk assessment 

Once you complete your business-based risk assessment, you can focus on the last element of your risk assessment, which consists of your clients and the business relationships you have with them. 

When you enter into a business relationship with a client, you have to keep a record of the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship.Footnote 14 You also have to review this information on a periodic basis, which will help you determine the risk of ML/TF and understand the patterns and transactional activity of your clients.Footnote 15 It is possible that your business deals with clients outside of business relationships. The interactions with these clients may be sporadic (for example, few transactions over time that are under the identification threshold requirement). As such, there will not be a lot of information available to assess these clients. The risk assessment of such clients may focus on the transactional or contextual information at your disposal, rather than on a detailed client file. 

If you do not have business relationships, it is not necessary for you to complete a relationship-based risk assessment worksheet for low and medium risk clients. However, if you have high-risk clients outside of business relationships, you should include them in a relationship-based risk assessment. For example, clients that were included in a suspicious transaction report (STR) you submitted to FINTRAC. 

To conduct a relationship-based risk assessment, you need to identify the inherent risks of ML/TF for your clients. You can assess the ML/TF risks for individual clients or for groups of clients with similar characteristics. Your overall relationship-based risk assessment includes the risk posed by the following: 

* 1. The combination of products, services and delivery channels your client uses;
* 2. The geographical location of the client and their transactions;
* 3. The new developments and technologies you make available to your clients; and
* 4. Client characteristics and patterns of activity or transactions.

###### 1. Products, services and delivery channels 

In the relationship-based risk assessment, you are looking at the products, services and delivery channels that your clients are using and the impact they have on your clients' overall risk. 

Product risks: 

Products will have a higher inherent risk when there is client anonymity or when the source of funds is unknown. 

Where possible, it is advisable that you complete a review of such products with the employees who handle them to ensure the completeness of the risk assessment. 

Service risks: 

You should include in your risk assessment services that have been identified as potentially posing a high-risk by government authorities or other credible sources. 

For example, potentially higher risk services could include: international electronic funds transfers (EFTs), international correspondent banking services, international private banking services, services involving banknote and precious metal trading and delivery, or front money accounts for casinos. 

Delivery channel risks: 

You should consider delivery channels as part of your risk assessment, given the potential impact of new developments and technologies. 

Delivery channels that allow for non-face-to-face transactions pose a higher inherent risk. Many delivery channels do not bring the client into direct face-to-face contact with you (for example, internet, telephone or new products such as virtual currency, chat applications, online document signing, etc.) and are accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, from almost anywhere. This can be used to obscure the true identity of a client or beneficial owner, and therefore poses a higher risk. Although some delivery channels may have become the norm (for example, the use of internet for banking), you should nonetheless consider them in combination with other factors that could make a specific element, client or group of clients high-risk. 

Some products, services and delivery channels inherently pose a higher risk. See Annex 5 — Table 9: Relationship-based examples of higher risk indicators and considerations for products, services and delivery channels. 

###### 2. Geography 

In the business-based risk assessment, you have identified high-risk elements related to the geographical location of your business. In the relationship-based risk assessment, you will look at the geography of your clients or business relationships and its impact on their overall risk. 

Your business faces increased ML/TF risks when you receive funds from or destined to high-risk jurisdictions, and when a client has a material connection to a high- risk country. You should assess the risks associated with your clients and business relationships such as residency in a high-risk jurisdiction or transactions with those jurisdictions. 

See Annex 5 — Table 10: Relationship-based examples of higher risk indicators and considerations for geography. 

###### 3. Impacts of new developments and technologies 

In the business-based risk assessment, you assessed potential high-risk elements related to the introduction of new developments and technologies in your business model, prior to implementing them. In the relationship-based risk assessment, you will examine the potential impacts that new developments (putting in place a new service/activity/location) and technologies (introducing a new technology) could have on your clients, affiliates, and anyone with whom you have a business relationship. 

New developments and technologies can increase risk, as they may provide another layer of anonymity. For example, your business faces an increased risk of ML/TF when funds come from or are destined to high-risk jurisdictions, and when the origin of the funds can not be determined or is unknown, etc. 

See Annex 5 — Table 11: Relationship-based examples of higher risk indicators and considerations for new developments and technologies. 

###### 4. Client characteristics and patterns of activity or transactions 

At the beginning of a business relationship, and periodically throughout the relationship, you should consider the purpose and intended nature of the relationship. Doing so will help you understand your clients' activities and transaction patterns, in order to determine their level of ML/TF risk. Your policies and procedures must reflect this process. 

To help you with the overall risk assessment of a client or group of clients, you should also consider known risk factors that can increase a client's overall ML/TF risk rating, such as: 

criminal history of the client in regards to a designated offence. unknown source of funds; beneficiary of the transaction is unknown; individual conducting the transaction in unknown; absence of detail in the transaction records; unusual speed, volume and frequency of transactions; or unexplained complexity of accounts or transactions. 

Similarly, you should also look at factors that can decrease a client's ML/TF risk, such as: 

a low volume of activity; a low aggregate balance; low dollar value transactions; or household expense accounts or accounts for the investments of funds that are subject to a regulatory scheme (for example, Registered Retirement Savings Plan). 

Some client characteristics or patterns of activity will pose an inherently higher risk of ML/TF. For examples of: 

higher risk client characteristics and patterns of activity, see Annex 5 — Table 12: Relationship-based examples of higher risk indicators and rationale for client characteristics and patterns of activity; 

client characteristics that can be considered higher risk, see FINTRAC's ML/TF indicators; and additional higher risk indicators and rationale, see Annex 5 — Table 13: Relationship-based examples of additional higher risk indicators and related considerations. 

You can assess the ML/TF risk for individual clients or for groups of clients. This assessment could take the form clusters (or groups) of clients with similar characteristics. For example, you can group together clients with similar incomes, occupations and portfolios, or those who conduct similar types of transactions. This approach can be especially practical for financial institutions. 

It is important to remember that identifying one high-risk indicator for a client does not necessarily mean that the client poses a high-risk ( with the exception of the three indicators highlighted in Table 12). Your relationship-based risk assessment model ultimately draws together the products, services and delivery channels used by your client, your client's geographical risk and your client's characteristics and patterns of activity. It is up to you to determine how to best assess the risk each client or group of clients poses. 

Every high-risk client (or group of clients) will need to be subjected to prescribed special measures (see step 3). You will have to document these measures in your policies and procedures, and document how you apply them to your high-risk clients.Footnote 16 

You can use a Likelihood and impact matrix like the one in Annex 4 to help you evaluate your relationship-based risk. 

Relationship-based risk assessment worksheet 

Using a relationship-based risk assessment worksheet could be an easy way to document the inherent risks related to your clients and your business relationships with them. The worksheet below is given an example. You can also develop your own worksheet or method to document the inherent risks related to your clients. 



| Column A | Column B: | Column C: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Business relationships and/or high- risk clients Identify all your business relationships and/or high-risk clients (individually or as groups). | Risk rating Rate each business relationship and/or client (or group of clients) (for example, low, medium or high risk). | Rationale Explain why you assigned that particular rating to each business relationship and/or client (or group of clients). |
| - Group A / Client A | Low-risk | Known group or client conducting standardtransactions in line with their profile. |
| - Group B / Client B | High-risk | Conducts several large cash transactions thatseem to be beyond their means. |

#### RBA cycle — Step 2: Setting your risk tolerance 

Risk tolerance is an important component of effective risk management. Consider your risk tolerance before deciding how you will address risks. When considering threats, the concept of risk tolerance will allow you to determine the level of risk exposure that you consider tolerable. 

To do so, you may want to consider the following types of risk which can affect your organization: 

regulatory risk; reputational risk; legal risk; or financial risk. 

The PCMLTFA and associated Regulations state that reporting entities have obligations when they identify high-risk business activities and high-risk clients. Setting a high risk tolerance does not allow reporting entities to avoid these obligations. 

To set your risk tolerance, some questions that you may want to answer are: 

Are you willing to accept regulatory, reputational, legal or financial risks? Which risks are you willing to accept after implementing mitigation measures? Which risks are you not willing to accept? 

This should help you determine your overall risk tolerance (notwithstanding your mandatory obligations). 

#### RBA cycle — Step 3: Creating risk-reduction measures and key controls 

Risk mitigation is the implementation of controls to manage the ML/TF risks you have identified while conducting your risk assessment. It includes: 

* 1. In all situations, your business should consider implementing internal controls that will help mitigate your overall risk.
* 2. For your business-based risk assessment, you will have to document and mitigate all the high-risk elements identified by your assessment with controls or measures.Footnote 17
* 3. For all your clients and business relationships, you will be required to:Footnote 18 
	+ 1. Conduct ongoing monitoring of all your business relationships; and
	+ 2. Keep a record of the measures and information obtained through this monitoring.
* 4. For your high-risk clients and business relationships, you will be required to adopt the prescribed special measures, including:Footnote 19 
	+ 1. Conducting enhanced monitoring of these clients and business relationships.
	+ 2. Taking enhanced measures to verify their identity and/or keep client information up to date.

Implementing risk mitigation measures will allow your business to stay within your risk tolerance. It is important to note that having a higher risk tolerance may lead to your business accepting higher risk situations and/or clients. If you accept to do business in higher risk situations and/or with higher risk clients, you should have stronger mitigation measures and controls in place to adequately address the risks. 

For detailed information on risk mitigation measures, please consult FINTRAC's Compliance program requirements guidance. 

#### RBA cycle — Step 4: Evaluating your residual risks 

Your residual risks should be in line with your risk tolerance. It is important to note that no matter how robust your risk mitigation measures and risk management program is, your business will always have exposure to some residual ML/TF risk that you must manage. If your residual risk is greater than your risk tolerance, or your measures and controls do not sufficiently mitigate high-risk situations or high-risk posed by clients, you should go back to step 3 and review the mitigation measures that were put in place. 

If your business is willing to deal with high-risk situations and/or clients, FINTRAC expects that the mitigation measures or controls put in place (see step 3) will be commensurate with the level of risk, and that the residual risks will be reasonable and acceptable. 

Types of residual risk: 

Tolerated risks: These are risks that you accept because there is no benefit in trying to reduce them. Tolerated risks may increase over time. For example, when you introduce a new product or a new threat appears. 

Mitigated risks: These are risks that you have reduced but not eliminated. In practice, the controls put in place may fail from time to time (for example, you do not report a transaction within the prescribed timeframe because your transaction review process has failed). 

This is an example of a business further mitigating risk because over time their risks and clients have evolved: 

Business A offers international EFTs as a service to its clients. Reporting systems are in place to capture transactions of $10,000 or more, and Business A has developed policies and procedures to properly verify identity for transactions of $1,000 or more. A reporting system is also in place to identify transactions that could be related to an ML/TF offence (for suspicious transaction reporting purposes). 

Since Business A considers international EFTs to be a high-risk service, it added a mitigation measure to control the risk associated with the service. The staff (through the training program) is reminded regularly of the risks associated with international EFTs and are made aware of updates and changes to high-risk jurisdictions as indicated in government advisories. These measures were put in place by Business A years ago and are well understood and followed by the staff. 

In this example, the mitigation measures put in place at the time were in line with the risk tolerance of Business A in regards to international EFTs. As such, the residual risk was tolerable for Business A. 

However, as risks and/or clients changed over time, Business A now feels that the mitigation measures are no longer sufficient to meet its risk tolerance. In fact, Business A's risk tolerance is now lower than it used to be (that is, it is less inclined to take on high-risks). The residual risks from the previously established mitigation measures now exceed the new risk tolerance. 

Business A will add new mitigation measures to realign the residual risk with its new tolerance level. Some examples of additional mitigation measures are: 

put a limit on specific transactions (for example, international EFTs to specific jurisdictions); require additional internal approvals for certain transactions; and/or monitor some transactions more frequently to help reduce the risk of structuring (for example, a $12,000 transaction that is split into two $6,000 transactions to avoid reporting). 

#### RBA cycle — Step 5: Implementing your RBA 

You will implement your RBA as part of your day-to-day activities. 

You must document your risk assessment as part of your compliance program.Footnote 20 A detailed and well-documented compliance program shows your commitment to preventing, detecting and addressing your organization's ML/TF risks. 

Risk and risk mitigation requires the leadership and engagement of your senior management (should this apply to your business). Senior management or your business owner is ultimately accountable, and may be responsible for making decisions related to policies, procedures and processes that mitigate and control ML/TF risks. 

For more information, please consult FINTRAC's Compliance program requirements guidance. 

#### RBA cycle — Step 6: Reviewing your RBA 

You must institute and document a periodic review (minimum of every two years) of your compliance program, to test its effectiveness, which includes reviewing:Footnote 21 

your policies and procedures; your risk assessment related to ML/TF; and your training program (for employees and senior management). 

If your business model changes and you offer new products or services, you should update your risk assessment along with your policies and procedures, mitigating measures and controls, as appropriate. 

When reviewing your risk assessment to test its effectiveness, you must cover all components, including your policies and procedures on risk assessment, risk mitigation strategies and special measures which include your enhanced ongoing monitoring procedures. This will help you evaluate the need to modify existing policies and procedures or to implement new ones. Consequently, the completion of this step is crucial to the implementation of an effective RBA. 

For more information, please consult FINTRAC's Compliance program requirements guidance. 

## Annex 1 — FINTRAC's RBA expectations Overall expectations 

There is no standard risk assessment methodology. In building a new or validating an existing risk assessment, you may find this guidance useful to inform your risk assessment. However, you should not limit yourself to the information provided in this guidance when developing your own RBA. 

The expectations below are at a high level. FINTRAC's risk assessment expectations for each step of the RBA cycle are described further in this annex. 

Your risk assessment must be documented and should: reflect the reality of your business; include all prescribed elements (products, services and delivery channels, geography, new developments and technologies, affiliates if applicable, and any other factors relevant to your business); and 

be shared with FINTRAC during an examination upon request. 

You need to tailor your risk assessment to your business size and type. For example, FINTRAC would expect a more detailed assessment from REs that conduct large volumes of transactions across various business lines and/or products. Additionally, FINTRAC would expect the overall business-based risk rating for larger REs to have separate risk ratings for different lines of business. 

You need to document all steps of your risk assessment, the process you followed, and the rationale that supports your risk assessment. 

During an examination, FINTRAC may review: your risk assessment, your controls and mitigating measures (including your policies and procedures) to assess the overall effectiveness of your risk assessment; 

your business relationships and evaluate whether they have been assessed based on the products, services, delivery channels, geographical risk, impact of new developments and technologies and other characteristics or patterns of activities; your high-risk client files to ensure that the prescribed special measures have been applied; your records to assess whether monitoring and reporting are done in accordance with the PCMLTFA and associated Regulations and with your policies and procedures; and 

whether your prescribed review (to be conducted at least once every two years) appropriately assessed the effectiveness of your business and relationship-based risk assessment. 

### Expectations for Step 1 — Identification of your inherent risks 

FINTRAC expects that: 

You have considered and assessed your business risks (including, products, services and delivery channels, geography, new developments and technologies, affiliates if applicable, and any other factors relevant to your business) and you are able to provide a rationale for your assessment. For every element that you assess as posing a high-risk, you will need to document the controls and mitigation measures you are taking. You need to be able to show that these controls and measures have been implemented. 

You have considered and assessed your clients and business relationships based on the products, services and delivery channels they use, on their geography, and on their characteristics and patterns of activity. You can do this by: 

Demonstrating that you have assessed the risks posed by each client you have a business relationship with; or Assessing groups of clients or of business relationships that share similar characteristics, as long as you can demonstrate that the groupings are logical and specific enough to reflect the reality of your business. 

You can provide documented information that demonstrates that you have considered high-risk indicators in your assessment (such as those included in this guidance where applicable). 

In situations where high-risk indicators are not considered (for example, FINTRAC considers a specific element to pose a high-risk but you decide that the element poses a lower level of risk), you must be able to provide a reasonable rationale. 

For every high-risk relationship, you have put in place the prescribed special measures and document these measures in your policies and procedures. 

If you use a checklist for your risk assessment, you must be able to provide a documented analysis of the risk that draws conclusions on your business's vulnerabilities to ML/TF and the threats it faces, including the required elements (referred to above). 

If your business is using a service provider to perform the risk assessment, you are nonetheless ultimately responsible to ensure that the for the risk assessment obligation is met correctly. 

### Expectations for Step 2 — Set your risk tolerance 

FINTRAC expects that: 

You take time to establish your risk tolerance, as it is an important component of effectively assessing and managing your risks. 

Your risk tolerance will have a direct impact on creating risk-reduction measures and controls, on your policies and procedures, and on training (step 3). 

Setting your risk tolerance includes obtaining approval from senior management (should that be a part of your business structure). 

### Expectations for Step 3 — Create risk-reduction measures and key controls 

FINTRAC expects that: 

You keep the client identification and beneficial ownership information of your business relationships up to date.Footnote 22 

You establish and conduct the appropriate level of ongoing monitoring for your business relationships (taking enhanced measures for high-risk clients).Footnote 23 

You implement mitigation measures for situations where the risk of ML/TF is high (for your business-based risks and relationship-based risks). These written mitigation strategies must be included in your policies and procedures. 

Apply your controls and procedures consistently. FINTRAC may assess them through transaction testing. 

### Expectations for Step 4 — Evaluate your residual risks 

FINTRAC expects that: 

You take the time to evaluate your level of residual risk. 

You confirm that the level of residual risk is aligned with your risk tolerance (as described in step 2). 

### Expectations for Step 5 — Implement your RBA 

FINTRAC expects that: 

Your RBA process is documented, and includes your ongoing monitoring procedures (including their frequency) and the measures and controls put in place to mitigate the high-risks identified in step 1. 

You apply your RBA as described in your documentation. 

You keep the client and beneficial ownership information of your business relationships up to date.Footnote 24 You conduct ongoing monitoring of all your business relationships.Footnote 25 

You apply the appropriate prescribed special measures to your high-risk clients and business relationships.Footnote 26 

You involve the persons responsible for compliance when dealing with high-risk situations (for example, when dealing with foreign politically exposed persons (PEPs), obtain senior management approval to keep accounts open after a determination has been made). 

### Expectations for Step 6 — Review your RBA 

FINTRAC expects that: 

You conduct a review at least every two years, or when there are changes to your business model, when you acquire a new portfolio, etc.Footnote 27 

This prescribed review will test the effectiveness of your entire compliance program, including your compliance policies and procedures, your risk assessment of ML/TF risks and your ongoing training program.Footnote 28 

You document the review and report it to senior management within 30 days.Footnote 29 

You document the results of the review, along with corrective measures and follow-up actions.Footnote 30

Could your clients use the products or services on behalf of third parties? |
| Delivery channels, such as transactions for which an individual is not physically present, including * - agent network * - online trading | Your delivery channels may have a higher inherent risk if you offer non face-to-face transactions, use agents, or if clients can initiate a business relationship online. This is especially true if you rely on an agent (that may or may not be covered by the PCMLTFA) to verify the identity of your clients. For the purpose of the PCMLTFA, REs are accountable for the activities conducted by their agents. In addition, new delivery channels (for example, products or services such as virtual currency) may pose inherently higher ML/TF risks due to the anonymous nature of transactions when conducted remotely. |

Products and services offered that are based on new developments and technologies such as electronic wallets, mobile payments, or virtual currencies, may be considered higher risk as they can transmit funds quickly and anonymously.

| Events and patterns | Depending on your clientele, are there events or patterns (either domestic or international) that could affect your business? For example, you may be dealing with clients that have a connection to high-risk jurisdictions or with jurisdictions that are dealing with a specific event (such as terrorism, war, etc.). You do not need to classify all activities and clients as posing a high-risk in relation to an event, conflict or high-risk jurisdiction. However, you should be aware |

If you and/or your clients have no |

If your business offers such products, services and delivery channels, you must assess them for ML/TF risks to your business. 

### Methods of communication or identification 

Your business may communicate with clients through means other than the telephone and email or your clients may use new ways to communicate with you or identify themselves to you. Communications means are evolving continually and can affect your overall inherent risks.

These examples highlight the fact that your risk assessment should be related to other compliance program elements, such as training. Training should give employees an understanding of the reporting, client identificationand record keeping requirements, and an understanding of the penalties for not meeting those requirements. If |

you have numerous branches or a high employee turnover, your training program should address these risks. 

It is also important to remember that although the use of a third party or service provider can be a good business practice, your business is ultimately responsible for complying with your obligations under the PCMLTFA and associated Regulations. You will want to ensure that you fully understand how your third party or service provider is functioning. 

Table 5: Business-based examples of higher risk indicators and considerations for other relevant factors 

The table below lists examples of risk factors you could encounter as part of your business-based risk assessment. It also provides a rationale on how you could differentiate between risk ratings. 

Please note that: 

* 1. The PCMLTFA and associated Regulations do not require you to use a low, medium and high scale. You could use low and high-risk categories only. You must establish a risk scale and you must tailor the risk scale to your business's size and type.
* 2. Utilizing a table similar to this one is not in itself a risk assessment, as it does not meet the requirement as stated in the Regulations. However, the table below is an example of a business-based risk assessment. It does not consider your clients or business relationships.

This list includes inherent risks that have not been mitigated yet. By law, controls or mitigation measures are required for all high-risk factors. 



| Factors | Low | Medium | High |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Products & services — Electronic transactions | No electronic transaction services | You have some electronic transaction services and offer limited products and services | You offer a wide array of electronic transactions services |
| Products & services — Currency transactions | Few or no large transactions | Medium volume of large transactions | Significant volume of large or structured transactions |
| Products & services — EFTs | Limited number of funds and transfers of low value for clients and non-clients Limited third party transactions and no foreign funds transfers | Regular funds transfers and transfers of medium value Few international funds transfers from personal or business accounts with typically low-risk countries | Frequent funds transfers and transfers of high value from personal or business accounts, to or from high-risk jurisdictions and financial secrecy jurisdictions |
| Products & services (business model) — International exposure | Few international accounts or very low volume of transactions in international accounts | Some international accounts with unexplained transactions | High number of international accounts with unexplained transactions |
| Geography (location) — Prevalence of crime | All locations are in an area known to have a low crime rate | One or a few locations are in an area known to have an average crime rate | One or a few locations are in an area known to have a high crime rate and/or criminal organization(s) |

Table 6: Examples of risk segregation for a business-based risk assessment 

Note: Some of the descriptors in the above table are vague (such as "some", "significant", etc.). A table such as this one needs to be customized to the reality of your business. For example, if FINTRAC states that it considers a "significant volume of transactions with high-risk countries" as posing a high-risk, this could mean that a business could compare the transactions to high-risk countries to the overall quantity of transactions conducted by their business. If a business conducting 600 transactions with high-risk-countries out of 1,000 monthly transactions it has a "significant" inherent risk. Qualifiers depend on the specifics of your own business. 

## Annex 4 — Likelihood and impact matrix 

You can use the likelihood and impact matrix described below for your business and client risks. It can help you determine the level of effort or monitoring required for inherent risks. You use the matrix or develop your own to better reflect the realities of your business. 

Likelihood is the chance of an ML/TF risk is present. What is the likelihood that the identified risks are actually present? The "likelihood" is the level of risk you have identified as part of your business-based risk assessment and/or your relationship-based risk assessment (for example, a client assessed as posing a medium risk). You can use a scale similar to this one: 



| Rating | Likelihood of ML/TF risk |
| --- | --- |
| High | High probability that the risk is presen |
| Medium | Reasonable probability that the risk ispresent |

Impact isthe damage incurred if ML/TF occurs. Depending on business circumstances, the impact could be a financial loss, or a regulatory, legal, reputational or other impact. To help you determine the impact of your ML/TF risks, you can use a scale similar to this one: 



| Rating | Likelihood of ML/TF risk |
| --- | --- |
| High | The risk has severe consequences |
| Medium | The risk has moderate consequences |
| Low | The risk has minor or noconsequences |

Table 8: Rating and impact of the ML/TF risk 

You can use the matrix to help you decide which actions to take considering the overall risk. Each box in the matrix shows the level of resources required for: 

action (the need to respond to the risk) effort (level of effort required to mitigate the risk) monitoring (level of monitoring required) 

### Diagram 4: Likelihood and impact matrix

The following graphic is called the likelihood and impact matrix. It is made up of 2 axes. The vertical axis is the likelihood of ML/TF risk while the horizontal axis is the impact of ML/TF. Each axis contains 3 levels of risk – low, medium and high - for a total of 9 boxes within the matrix. 

On the impact axis, the left side represents the low risk category, the middle being medium risk and the right side representing high risk. On the vertical axis, the bottom represents the low risk category, the middle being medium risk and the top representing high risk. 

The 9 boxes within the matrix represent various combinations of risk. In addition, each box contains a level of resource required for: action (i.e. the need to respond to risk), effort (i.e. level of effort required to mitigate the risk) and monitoring (i.e. level of monitoring required). The level of resource is being represented by level 0, being the lowest, up to level 3 being the highest. 

* 1. The box on the lower left corner (low impact and low likelihood) represents the lowest overall risk. Action is at level 0 while effort and monitoring are at level 1.
* 2. The box immediately to its right (medium impact and low likelihood) is also considered to be in the lower overall risk. Action is at level 0 while effort and monitoring are at level 1.
* 3. The box on the bottom right corner (high impact and low likelihood) represents a medium / low overall risk. Action and effort are at level 1 while monitoring is at level 2.
* 4. The box located at low impact and medium likelihood is considered to be in the lower overall risk. Action is at level 0 while effort and monitoring are at level 1.
* 5. The box immediately to its right, at the centre of the matrix (medium impact and medium likelihood), is considered to be medium overall risk. Action, effort and monitoring are at level 2.
* 6. The box located at high impact and medium likelihood is considered to be in the higher overall risk. Action, effort and monitoring are at level 3.
* 7. The box on the top left corner (low impact and high likelihood) represents a medium / low overall risk. Action and effort are at level 1 while monitoring is at level 2.
* 8. The box immediately to its right (medium impact and high likelihood), is considered to be in the higher overall risk. Action, effort and monitoring are at level 3.
* 9. The box on the top right corner (high impact and high likelihood) represents the highest overall risk. Action, effort and monitoring are at level 3.
### How to read the matrix 

Box 6 may not require any response, effort or monitoring because you consider both the likelihood and impact to be low. 

Box 3 will require you to allocate resources for action, effort and monitoring. You will want to monitor all business risks and business relationships that are in box 3 to ensure that the risks identified do not move into the red categories (boxes 1 and 2). 

In Box 1, you have identified the risks to be highly likely to occur and to have a severe impact on your business. Anything in this box (for example, business risks, business relationship, etc.) would require the most resources for action, effort, and monitoring. 

### Examples 

#### Example 1 

low-risk if situated in boxes 5–6; medium-risk if situated in boxes 3–4; and high-risk if situated in boxes 1–2. 

For the example below, you should consider all risk factors or clients as: 

You complete the risk assessment of clients A and B and determine that they both have the same likelihood of ML/TF risk: medium. 

Taking a closer look at their accounts, you realize that both have EFTs on file (product/service with a high inherent risk). However, client A has not conducted an EFT in months and you know that the EFTs were to family members abroad. However, client B regularly conducts EFTs but you do not know a lot about the recipients or the reasons for the EFTs. 

As such, you could assess the impact of the ML/TF risk to be greater with client B than with client A. You could decide to leave client A in the medium impact category (placing the client in box 3) and to move client B to the high-impact category (placing the client in box 2). You should document your decision and rationale. 

In this example, you would need to implement mitigation measures for client B, who is now a high-risk client. 

After completing the risk assessment of clients A and B, you determine that they have the same likelihood of ML/TF risk: high. 

Taking a closer look at the volume of transactions both clients conduct, you see that client A conducts 1 transaction per week on average; whereas client B conducts several transactions every day. In this example, the impact not submitting suspicious transaction reports would be greater with client B because of the volume of transactions. 

You could decide to place client A in a lower category (placing the client in box 4) while client B could remain in a higher category (placing the client in box 1 or 2). You should document your decision and rationale 

In this example, you would implement mitigation measures for client B, who is now a high-risk client. 

#### Example 3 

In this scenario, an RE applies the risk matrix to risk elements identified in their risk assessment: 



| Risk factor | Likelihood | Impact | Overall | Mitigation measures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clients always use cash as method of payment | High | Medium | High (box * 2) | relationships. * - Obtain additional information beyond the minimum requirements about the intended nature and purpose of the business relationship, including type of business activity. |

| Your clients use electronic funds payment services such as: * - EFTs * - electronic cash | EFTs can be done in a non-face-to-face environment. Additionally, transmitting large amounts funds outside of Canada or into Canada can disguise the origin of the funds. Electronic cash is a higher risk service because it can allow unidentified parties to conduct transactions. |
| Your clients use products such as bank drafts and letters of credit. | number, etc.). Letters of credit are essentially a guarantee from a bank that a seller will receive payment for goods. While guaranteed by a bank, letters of credit have a higher inherent ML/TF risk as they can be used in trade-based transactions to increase the appearance of legitimacy and reduce the risk of detection. Money launderers using trade-based transactions (for example, seller or importer) may also use under or over valuation schemes, which will allow them to move moneunder the veil of legitimacy. There is also higher risk when letters of credit are not used in a way consistent with the usual pattern of activity of the client. |
| Your clients use some products and services that you offer through non- face-to-face channels or use intermediaries, agents or introducers (refer clients or businesses to you for specific products or services). | Using intermediaries or agents may increase your inherent risks, because intermediaries or agents may lack adequate supervision if they are not subject to anti-money laundering and anterrorist financing (AML/ATF) laws or measures. It is important to note that under the PCMLTFA, you are accountable for the activities conductby all your agents. As a result, you need to ensure that they meet all compliance obligations oan ongoing basis. Furthermore, you should have due diligence processes in place (such as background checks and ongoing monitoring) to lessen the risk of your agent network being usfor ML/TF purposes. |

Bank drafts can move large amounts of funds in bearer form without the bulkiness of cash. They are much like cash in the sense that the holder of the draft is the owner of the money. For example, a 100,000 dollar bank draft (showing a financial institution as the payee) and can be passed from one person to another, effectively blurring the money trail. 

You can mitigate the inherent risk of this product when it is issued as payable only to specific payees and when the information about the draft's originator are included (name, account

Non-face-to-face transactions can make it more difficult to verify the identity of your clients.

| Your client's proximity to a branch or location | A client that conducts business or transactions away from their home branch or address without reasonable explanation. For example, one of your clients conducts transactions at different branches across a broad geographical area over one day and this does not appear to be practical. |
| Your client is a non- resident | Identifying non-resident clients may prove to be more difficult if they are not present and as such, could raise the inherent level of risk. |
| Your client has offshore business activities or interests | Is there a legitimate reason for your client to have offshore interests? Offshore activities may be used by a person to add a layer of complexity to transactions, thus raising the overall risk of ML/TF. |
| Your client's connection to high- risk countries | Take your client's connection to high-risk countries into account as some countries have weaker or inadequate AML/ATF standards, insufficient regulatory supervision or present a greater risk for crime, corruption or TF. |



| Examples of higher risk indicators | Considerations |
| --- | --- |
| Changing payment methods | The variety of payment methods made possible by advancements in technology is a potential risk for ML/TF. Many countries and companies have moved to a "cashless world" approach. As a result, clients are using alternative payment methods such as e-wallets. It is important to analyze the risk associated with these payment methods (for example, anonymity, borderless transactions, speed of the transactions, vulnerabilities in terms of know your client requirements) to determine how the technology used by your clients may increase their risk level. |
| A new service or |  |

| Your client is in possession or control of property that you know/believe is owned or controlled by or on behalf of a terrorist or a terrorist group | You are required to send a terrorist property report to FINTRAC if you have property in your possession or control that you know/believe is owned or controlled by or on behalf of a terrorist or terrorist group. This includes information about transactions or proposed transactions relating to that property. Once you file a terrorist property report, the client automatically becomes high-risk. |
| Your client is a foreign PEP | their position and the influence they may hold, a foreign PEP, their family members and their close associates are vulnerable to ML/TF and other offences such as corruption. As a business, you musconsider a foreign PEP, their family members and their close associates as a high-risk client. |

For more information, please consult FINTRAC's Beneficial ownership requirements guidance. It is important to note that when you do have the information on beneficial ownership, there may be other information or indicators that would make this relationship pose a higher risk. |

| The account activity does not match the client profile | Account activity that does not match the client profile may indicate a higher risk of ML/TF. You may face situations where you have submitted several large cash transaction reports to FINTRAC about a client with an occupation that does not match this type of activity (for example, student, unemployed, etc.). |
| Your client's business generates cash for transactions not normally cash intensive | The fact that there is no legitimate reason for the business to generate cash represents a higher risk of ML/TF. |
| Your client's business is a cash-intensive business (such as a bar, a club, etc.) | Certain types of business, especially those that are cash-intensive may have a higher inherent risk for ML/TF because legitimate money can be co-mingled with illegitimate money. For example, clients that own white label ATMs. |
| Your client offers online gambling | Industry intelligence, including reports from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, indicates that due to the nature of the business, the gambling sector is susceptible to ML activity. Additionally, the FATF has indicated that internet payment systems are an emerging risk in the gambling industry. Internet payment systems are used to conduct transactions related to online gambling, these two factors make the online gambling industry inherently higher risk. As well, higher inherent risk may exist if the online gambling activities are not managed by provincial lottery and gaming corporations. |
| Your client's business structure (or transactions) seems unusually or unnecessarily complex | An unnecessarily complex business structure or complex client transactions (compared to what you normally see in a similar circumstance) may indicate that the client is trying to hide transactions or suspicious activities. |
| Your client is a financial institution with which you have a correspondent banking relationship; or Your client is a correspondent bank that has been subject to appropriate | Some countries have weaker or inadequate AML/ATF standards, insufficient regulatory supervision or simply present a greater risk for crime, corruption or TF. Additionally, the nature of the businesses that your correspondent bank client engages in and the type of markets it serves may present greater risks. The fact that your client has been subject to sanctions should raise the risk level and you should put measures in place to monitor the account. |

| Your client is an intermediary or a gatekeeper (such as a lawyer or accountant) holding accounts for | Accountants, lawyers and other professionals sometimes hold co-mingled funds accounts for which beneficial ownership may be difficult to verify. This does not mean that all clients with these occupations are high-risk. You need to be aware of the risks that exist for these occupations and determine if the activities of the clients are in line with what you would expect and with the intended purpose of the account (for example a personal, business or trust account). |
