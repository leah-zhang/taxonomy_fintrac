# Money laundering and terrorist fnancing indicators—Financial entities 

From: Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) 

## Overview 

ML/TF indicators are potential red fags that could initiate suspicion or indicate that something may be unusual in the absence of a reasonable explanation. Red fags typically stem from one or more factual characteristics, behaviours, patterns or other contextual factors that identify irregularities related to fnancial transactions or attempted transactions. These often present inconsistencies with what is expected of your client based on what you know about them. 

The ML/TF indicators in this guidance were developed by FINTRAC through a three-year review of ML/TF cases, a review of high quality STRs, published literature by international organizations such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Egmont Group, and consultation with reporting entity sectors. These ML/TF indicators do not cover every possible situation but were developed to provide you with a general understanding of what is or could be unusual or suspicious. On its own, a single ML/TF indicator may not appear suspicious. However, observing an ML/TF indicator could lead you to conduct an assessment of the transaction(s) to determine whether there are further facts, contextual elements or additional ML/TF indicators that assist in establishing reasonable grounds to suspect the commission or attempted commission of an ML/TF offence which requires the submission of an STR. 

Criminal organizations often combine various methods in different ways in order to avoid the detection of ML/TF. If you detect unusual or suspicious behaviour or a transaction that prompts the need for an assessment, ML/TF indicators combined with facts and context can help you determine if there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction is related to the commission or attempted commission of an ML/TF offence. These ML/TF indicators may also be used to explain or articulate the rationale for your reasonable grounds to suspect in the narrative portion of an STR, as they provide valuable information from a fnancial intelligence perspective. 

## Important considerations 

### One piece of the puzzle 

The ML/TF indicators in this guidance are not an exhaustive list of ML/TF indicators to support all suspicious scenarios. These ML/TF indicators should be considered as examples to guide the development of your own process to determine when you have reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction or attempted transaction is related to the commission or attempted commission of an ML/TF offence. These ML/TF indicators are one piece of the puzzle and are designed to complement your own STR process and can be used in conjunction with other publicly available ML/TF indicators. 

During an assessment, FINTRAC will review your compliance policies and procedures to see how you use ML/TF indicators within your STR process. Part of the assessment will include evaluating how the actual policies follow your documented approach and determining its effectiveness with respect to the use of ML/TF indicators. This can include a review of transactions to determine how your STR process identifes potential STRs and assesses them using facts, context and ML/TF indicators. For example, you may be asked to provide an explanation if you have not reported an STR for a client you have assessed as high risk and that client's activity also matches against multiple ML/TF indicators. 

### Combination of facts, context and ML/TF indicators 

If the context surrounding a transaction is suspicious, it could lead you to assess a client's fnancial transactions. Facts, context and ML/TF indicators need to be assessed to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction is related to the commission or attempted commission of an ML/TF offence. On its own, a single fnancial transaction or ML/TF indicator may not appear suspicious. However, this does not mean you should stop your assessment. Additional facts or context about the client or their actions may help you reach the reasonable grounds to suspect threshold. 

### Alert or triggering system 

FINTRAC acknowledges that a reporting entity may have developed a system that relies on specifc alerts or triggering events to signal when to assess a transaction to determine if an STR should be submitted to FINTRAC. If you rely on such a system, FINTRAC expects that you review the alerts in a timely manner in order to determine if an STR should be submitted. Regardless of how you choose to operationalize these ML/TF indicators, FINTRAC expects that you will be able to demonstrate that you have an effective process to identify, assess and submit STRs to FINTRAC. 

## General ML/TF indicators 

The ML/TF indicators in the following section are applicable to both suspected ML and/or TF. The ability to detect, prevent and deter ML and/or TF begins with properly identifying the person or entity in order to review and report suspicious fnancial activity. 

As a fnancial entity, you may observe these ML/TF indicators over the course of your business activities with a client. It is important to note that depending on your business activities, some of these ML/TF indicators may not apply. 

### ML/TF indicators related to identifying the person or entity 

The following are examples of ML/TF indicators that you may observe when identifying persons or entities. 

There is an inability to properly identify the client or there are questions surrounding the client's identity. 

When opening an account, the client refuses or tries to avoid providing information required by the fnancial institution, or provides information that is misleading, vague, or difcult to verify. The client refuses to provide information regarding the benefcial owners of an account opened for an entity, or provides information that is false, conficting, misleading or substantially incorrect. 

The identifcation document presented by the client cannot be authenticated. 

There are inconsistencies in the identifcation documents or different identifers provided by the client, such as name, address, date of birth or phone number. 

Client produces seemingly false information or identifcation that appears to be counterfeited, altered or inaccurate. 

Client displays a pattern of name variations from one transaction to another or uses aliases. Client alters the transaction after being asked for identity documents. 

The client provides only a non-civic address or disguises a post ofce box as a civic address for the purpose of concealing their physical residence. 

Common identifers (e.g. addresses, phone numbers, etc.) are used by multiple clients that do not appear to be related. 

Common identifers (e.g. addresses, phone numbers, etc.) are used by multiple clients conducting similar transactions. 

Use of the same hotel address by one or more clients. 

Transactions involve persons or entities identifed by the media, law enforcement and/or intelligence agencies as being linked to criminal activities. 

Attempts to verify the information provided by a new or prospective client are difcult. 

### ML/TF indicators related to client behaviour 

The contextual information acquired through the know your client (KYC) requirements or the behaviour of a client, particularly surrounding a transaction or a pattern of transactions, may lead you to conduct an assessment in order to determine if you are required to submit an STR to FINTRAC. The following are some examples of ML/TF indicators that are linked to contextual behaviour and may be used in conjunction with your assessment and your risk-based approach. 

Client makes statements about involvement in criminal activities. 

Client conducts transactions at different physical locations, or approaches different tellers. Evidence of untruthfulness on behalf of the client (e.g. providing false or misleading information). Client exhibits nervous behaviour. 

Client refuses to provide information when required, or is reluctant to provide information. Client has a defensive stance to questioning. 

Client presents confusing details about the transaction or knows few details about its purpose. Client avoids contact with reporting entity employees. 

Client refuses to identify a source of funds or provides information that is false, misleading, or substantially incorrect. 

Client exhibits a lack of concern about higher than normal transaction costs or fees. 

Client makes enquiries/statements indicating a desire to avoid reporting or tries to persuade the reporting entity not to fle/maintain required reports. 

Insufcient explanation for the source of funds. 

Client closes account after an initial deposit is made without a reasonable explanation. 

### ML/TF indicators surrounding the fnancial transactions in relation to the person/entity profle 

Clearly understanding the expected activity of a person or entity will allow you to assess their fnancial activity with the proper lens. For example, an entity involved in an industry that is not normally cash- intensive receiving excessive cash deposits or a person conducting fnancial transactions atypical of their fnancial profle. The following are some examples of ML/TF indicators surrounding the fnancial transactions related to the person/entity profle. 

The transactional activity far exceeds the projected activity at the time of the account opening or the beginning of the relationship. 

The transactional activity (level or volume) is inconsistent with the client's apparent fnancial standing, their usual pattern of activities or occupational information (e.g. student, unemployed, social assistance, etc.). 

The volume of transactional activity exceeds the norm for geographical area. 

The transactional activity is inconsistent with what is expected from a declared business (e.g. business account has no normal business-related activities, such as the payment of payrolls or invoices). 

Client appears to be living beyond their means. 

Large and/or rapid movement of funds not commensurate with the client's fnancial profle. Rounded sum transactions atypical of what would be expected from the client. 

Size or type of transactions atypical of what is expected from the client. 

Opening accounts when the client's address or employment address is outside the local service area without a reasonable explanation. 

There is a sudden change in the client's fnancial profle, pattern of activity or transactions. 

Client uses notes, monetary instruments, or products and/or services that are unusual for such a client. 

### ML/TF indicators related to products and services 

Accounts can take different forms (e.g. chequing, savings, investment, etc.) and for the purposes of this section, the ML/TF indicators below will aim to address the ML/TF risks linked to different types of accounts held by various reporting entities in Canada. There are many ML/TF indicators related to account activity. Your process to evaluate risk for accounts and any other products and services you provide should be documented as part of your KYC and risk assessment requirements. The following ML/TF indicators will focus on products or services that may be applicable within your business. 

Holding multiple accounts at several fnancial institutions for no apparent reason. Suspected use of a personal account for business purposes, or vice-versa. 

Client appears to have recently established a series of new relationships with different fnancial entities. 

A product and/or service opened on behalf of a person or entity that is inconsistent based on what you know about that client. 

Frequent use of safety deposit box. 

Accounts used for pass-through activities (e.g. to receive and subsequently send funds to benefciaries). 

Use of multiple foreign bank accounts for no apparent reason. 

Credit card transactions and payments are exceptionally high for what is expected of the client including an excessive amount of cash advance usage, balance transfer requests or transactions involving luxury items. 

Client frequently makes credit card overpayments and then requests a cash advance. Frequent and/or atypical transfers between the client's products and accounts for no apparent reason. 

The same person holds signing authority for accounts held by multiple entities where there is no legal reason or sufcient explanation for such an arrangement. 

Accounts held by multiple entities either headquartered at the same location or having the same directors/signing authorities for no apparent reason. 

### ML/TF indicators related to change in account activity 

Certain changes regarding an account may be indicative of ML/TF for a multitude of reasons including, but not limited to, the use of an account to suddenly launder or transmit funds, an increase in volume, changes in ownership of an account, etc. Changes in account activity may trigger a need for further assessment of the person or entity holding the account and some examples to consider are listed below. 

A business account has a change in ownership structure with increases in transactional activity and no apparent explanation. 

An inactive account begins to see fnancial activity (e.g. deposits, wire transfers, withdrawals). Accounts that receive relevant periodical deposits and are inactive at other periods without a logical explanation. 

A sudden increase in credit card usage or applications for new credit. Abrupt change in account activity. 

### ML/TF indicators based on atypical transactional activity 

There are certain transactions that are outside the normal conduct of your everyday business. These transactions may be indicative of a suspicious transaction, and would require additional assessment. Some examples of ML/TF indicators based on atypical transactional activity are listed below. 

The client has multiple products, atypical of what would be expected. 

A series of complicated transfers of funds that seems to be an attempt to hide the source and intended use of the funds. 

Transactions displaying fnancial connections between persons or entities that are not usually connected (e.g. a food importer dealing with an automobile parts exporter). Transaction is unnecessarily complex for its stated purpose. 

Client presents notes or fnancial instruments that are packed, transported or wrapped in an uncommon way. 

A client's transactions have no apparent business or economic purpose. Transaction is consistent with a publicly known trend in criminal activity. Client deposits musty, odd smelling or extremely dirty bills. 

Transaction involves a suspected shell entity (an entity that does not have an economical or logical reason to exist). 

Client frequently exchanges small bills for larger bills. 

Suspicious pattern emerges from a client's transactions (e.g. transactions take place at the same time of day). 

Atypical transfers by a client on an in-and-out basis, or other methods of moving funds quickly, such as a cash deposit followed immediately by a wire transfer of the funds out. 

Funds transferred in and out of an account on the same day or within a relatively short period of time. 

### ML/TF indicators related to transactions structured below the reporting or identifcation requirements 

Structuring of transactions to avoid reporting or identifcation requirements is a common method for committing or attempting to commit an ML/TF offence. There are multiple thresholds which trigger reporting/identifcation requirements by a reporting entity. Some examples of ML/TF indicators which may be indicative of a person or entity attempting to evade identifcation and/or reporting thresholds are listed below. 

You become aware of the structuring of deposits at multiple branches or institutions. Client appears to be structuring amounts to avoid client identifcation or reporting thresholds. Client appears to be collaborating with others to avoid client identifcation or reporting thresholds. 

The structuring of deposits through multiple branches of the same fnancial institution or by groups of persons who enter a single branch at the same time. 

Multiple transactions conducted below the reporting threshold within a short period. Client makes enquiries that would indicate a desire to avoid reporting. 

Client conducts transactions at different physical locations or with different representatives in an apparent attempt to avoid detection. 

Client exhibits knowledge of reporting thresholds. 

### ML/TF indicators involving wire transfers (including electronic funds transfers) 

In our current global environment, it is increasingly easier to transfer funds to, from or through multiple jurisdictions (municipal, national or international) in a rapid fashion. This presents an increased ML/TF risk as transactions passing through multiple accounts and/or jurisdictions increase the difculty for reporting entities and law enforcement to trace illicit funds. Examples of these types of transactions which may require further assessment include the following. 

Client is unaware of details surrounding incoming wire transfers, such as the ordering client details, amounts or reasons. 

Client does not appear to know the sender of the wire transfer from whom the wire transfer was received, or the recipient to whom they are sending the wire transfer. 

Client frequents multiple locations utilizing cash, prepaid credit cards or money orders/cheques/drafts to send wire transfers overseas. 

The client sends wire transfers or receives wire transfers to or from multiple benefciaries that do not correspond to the expected use of the account type or business account. 

Client is accompanied by persons who appear to be instructing the sending or receiving of wire transfers on their behalf. 

Multiple persons are sending wire transfers that are similar in amounts, receiver names, security questions, addresses or destination country. 

Client attempts to specify the routing of an international wire transfer. 

Client conducts wire transfers that do not include theirs or the benefciary's requisite information. Client utilizes structured cash transactions to send wire transfers in an effort to avoid record keeping requirements. 

Funds are deposited or received into several accounts and then consolidated into one before transferring the funds outside the country. 

Immediately after transferred funds have cleared, the client moves funds, to another account or to another person or entity. 

Multiple clients have sent wire transfers over a short period of time to the same recipient. Large wire transfers or high volume of wire transfers are conducted or received through the account that does not ft the expected pattern of that account. 

Large and/or frequent wire transfers between senders and receivers with no apparent relationship. 

Client sending to, or receiving wire transfers from, multiple clients. 

### ML/TF indicators related to transactions that involve non-Canadian jurisdictions 

There are certain types of transactions that may be sent or received from jurisdictions outside of Canada where there is higher ML/TF risk due to more permissible laws or the local ML/TF threat environment. The following are examples to consider when making an assessment of the fnancial transaction conducted by a person/entity through your business. 

Transactions with jurisdictions that are known to produce or transit drugs or precursor chemicals, or are sources of other types of criminality. 

Transactions with jurisdictions that are known to be at a higher risk of ML/TF. Transaction/business activity involving locations of concern, which can include jurisdictions where there are ongoing conficts (and periphery areas), countries with weak ML/TF controls, or countries with highly secretive banking or other transactional laws. 

Transactions involving any countries deemed high risk or non-cooperative by the FATF. Client makes frequent overseas transfers, not in line with their fnancial profle. 

Due to the ever-evolving nature of the ML/TF environment, high risk jurisdictions and trends are often subject to change. To ensure that you are referencing accurate information, FINTRAC encourages you to research publicly available sources on a regular basis to support these ML/TF indicators as part of your STR process. There are multiple sources that identify jurisdictions of concern, including the FATF, which publishes contextual information on high-risk jurisdictions in relation to their risk of ML and TF. You may also observe funds coming from or going to jurisdictions that are reported in the media as locations where terrorists operate/carry out attacks and/or where terrorists have a large support base (state sponsors or private citizens). Identifying high-risk jurisdictions or known trends can also be included as part of your risk-based approach and internal STR process. 

### ML/TF indicators related to the use of other parties 

In the course of a "normal" fnancial transaction, there are a "normal" number of parties who engage in the transaction, depending on the nature of the transaction at hand. For example, in the instance of depositing cash to a personal bank account, there is generally one party to the transaction: the person who holds the account is depositing into their own account. By contrast, with the deposit of cash to a business account, you can have many different parties, including: persons associated with the business's fnance function who hold authority over the account, or an employee who may be charged with depositing the cash. 

Transactions that involve parties not typically associated with a transaction can present an elevated risk of ML and/or TF. These additional parties can be used to allow a criminal to avoid being identifed or being linked to an asset or account. This section includes examples of how the involvement of other parties may be indicative of the structure of a criminal enterprise. Some examples of such other parties include the use of a third party, nominee or gatekeeper. 

#### Use of third party 

A third party is any person or entity that instructs someone to act on their behalf for a fnancial activity or transaction. There are some situations where there is an apparent and discernable rationale for the inclusion of the third party in a transaction and this may not be suspicious. However, you may become suspicious in a situation where the reason for a person or entity acting on behalf of another person or entity does not make sense based on what you know about the client or the third party. Use of third parties is one method that money launderers and terrorist activity fnanciers use to distance themselves from the proceeds of crime or source of criminally obtained funds. By relying on other parties to conduct transactions they can distance themselves from the transactions that can be directly linked to the suspected ML/TF offence. Some examples of ML/TF indicators related to the use of a third party can be found below. 

Multiple deposits which are made to an account by non-account holders. 

Unrelated parties sending email money transfers or other forms of electronic transfers to the same benefciary with no apparent relation to the recipient. 

A client conducts a transaction while accompanied, overseen or directed by another party. A client makes numerous outgoing payments to unrelated parties shortly after they receive incoming funds. 

Wire transfers, deposits or payments to or from unrelated parties (foreign or domestic). Client appears to be or states they are acting on behalf of another party. 

Account is linked to seemingly unconnected parties. 

#### Use of nominee 

A nominee is a particular type of other party that is authorized to open accounts and conduct transactions on behalf of a person or entity. There are legitimate reasons for relying on a nominee to conduct fnancial activity of behalf of someone else. However, this type of activity is particularly vulnerable to ML/TF as it is a common method used by criminals to distance themselves from the transactions that could be linked to suspected ML/TF offences. These are some examples of ML/TF indicators relating to the misuse of nominees. 

A person maintains multiple accounts, or maintains accounts in the names of family members or corporate entities with no apparent business or other purpose. 

A person or entity other than the stated account holder conducts the majority of the transaction activity, which seems unnecessary or excessive. 

Client is involved in transactions or account activities that are suspicious, but refuses or is unable to answer questions related to the account or transactions. 

#### Use of gatekeeper 

A gatekeeper is a person who controls access to the fnancial system and can act on behalf of a client. Such services can be abused so that criminals have access to the fnancial system without being identifed. Gatekeepers may include lawyers, accountants and other professions which can access the fnancial system on behalf of a client. While there are many transactions where it is "normal" to have a gatekeeper represent the interests of a client, such an appearance of normalcy can also be utilized to the advantage of criminals to provide the veneer of legitimacy to their transactions. The use of gatekeepers themselves is not an indicator of an ML/TF offence. However, entities should consider the following examples which can indicate misuse of the fnancial system access provided to gatekeepers. 

Gatekeeper avoids identifying their client or disclosing their client's identity when such identifcation would be normal during the course of a transaction. 

Gatekeeper is willing to pay higher fees and seeks to conduct the transaction quickly when there is no apparent need for such expediency. 

Gatekeeper is utilizing their account for transactions not typical of their business (e.g. pass through account, excessive amount of cash, payment to non-clients or parties of transactions). Apparent misuse of correspondent accounts by gatekeeper to obscure the origin and/or destination of funds. 

## Indicators related to TF 

In Canada, TF offences make it a crime to knowingly collect or provide property, which can include fnancial or other related services, for terrorist purposes. This section is focused on examples that are specifc to the possible commission of a TF offence. However, please note that the other ML/TF indicators in this guidance may also prove relevant in determining when you have reasonable grounds to suspect the commission of TF, as the methods used by criminals to evade detection of ML are similar. 

### Indicators specifcally related to TF: 

The indicators below are some examples of indicators relating to TF. 

Transactions involving certain high-risk jurisdictions such as locations in the midst of or in proximity to, armed confict where terrorist groups operate or locations which are subject to weaker ML/TF controls. 

An account opened in the name of an entity, a foundation or association, which may be linked or involved with a suspected terrorist organization. 

The use of funds by a non-proft organization is not consistent with the purpose for which it was established. 

Raising donations in an unofcial or unregistered manner. 

Client identifed by media or law enforcement as having travelled, attempted or intended to travel to high-risk jurisdictions (including cities or districts of concern), specifcally countries (and adjacent countries) under confict and/or political instability or known to support terrorist activities and organizations. 

Transactions involve persons or entities identifed by media and/or sanctions lists as being linked to a terrorist organization or terrorist activities. 

Law enforcement information provided which indicates persons or entities may be linked to a terrorist organization or terrorist activities. 

Client conducted travel-related purchases (e.g. purchase of airline tickets, travel visa, passport, etc.) linked to high-risk jurisdictions (including cities or districts of concern), specifcally countries (and adjacent countries) under confict and/or political instability or known to support terrorist activities and organizations. 

Person or entity's online presence supports violent extremism or radicalization. 

Client donates to a cause that is subject to derogatory information that is publicly available (e.g. crowdfunding initiative, charity, non-proft organization, non-government organization

### 1. Who must comply 

All reporting entities and their employees must report suspicious transactions. 

If you are a person who is an employee of a reporting entity and your employer is actively reporting suspicious transactions, we do not require duplicate reporting. An employee is only expected to report suspicious transactions to FINTRAC in the rare instances where they believe that their employer has not submitted a Suspicious Transaction Report as required by the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (the Act) and associated Regulations. To submit a Suspicious Transaction Report in this scenario, the employee may use the paper report form as explained in section 4 below. 

A service provider can submit and correct a Suspicious Transaction Report on your behalf. However, as the reporting entity, you are ultimately responsible for meeting the requirements under the Act and associated Regulations, even if a service provider is reporting on your behalf. This legal responsibility cannot be delegated. 

No person or entity will be prosecuted for sending a Suspicious Transaction Report in good faith or for providing FINTRAC with information about suspicions of money laundering or terrorist fnancing.

section 133(2) 

### 2. What is a Suspicious Transaction Report 

A suspicious transaction report is a type of report that you must submit to FINTRAC when a fnancial transaction occurs, or is attempted, in the course of your activities and there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction is related to the commission or the attempted commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence. 

Note: You are not allowed to inform anyone, including the client, of the contents of a Suspicious Transaction Report, or that you have made or will make such a report, if the intent is to prejudice a criminal investigation. This applies whether such an investigation has begun or not. It is important to not tip off your client about the fact that you are fling a Suspicious Transaction Report—therefore, you should not be requesting information that you would not normally request during a transaction if you believe this would tip off the client. 

It is recommended that this guidance be read in conjunction with the following indicators, characteristics and guidance: 

Suspicious Transaction Indicators Report suspected sanctions evasion 

The Suspicious Transaction Report is one of the most valuable and unique report types submitted to FINTRAC. In addition to the prescribed information, Suspicious Transaction Reports allow you to expand the descriptive details surrounding a transaction that is derived from your assessment of what you are seeing through your business interactions and activities. 

FINTRAC uses the following types of information in its analysis and production of fnancial disclosures: 

aliases nicknames other names and initials benefcial ownership information IP addresses account numbers email addresses virtual currency transaction addresses and their details email money transfers (EMTs) mobile money transfers details of purchases locations relationships background information 

Because of the importance of FINTRAC's fnancial intelligence to the overall safety and security of Canadians and Canada's fnancial system, FINTRAC reviews and assesses every Suspicious Transaction Report it receives. When warranted, such as in the case of Suspicious Transaction Reports related to threats to the security of Canada, FINTRAC expedites its analysis in order to disclose fnancial intelligence to law enforcement and other intelligence partners within 24 hours.

### 3. What are reasonable grounds to suspect 

Reasonable grounds to suspect is the required threshold to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report to FINTRAC and is a step above simple suspicion, meaning that there is a possibility that a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence has occurred. 

You do not have to verify the facts, context or money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing indicators that led to your suspicion, nor do you have to prove that a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence has occurred in order to reach this threshold. Your suspicion must be reasonable and therefore, not biased or prejudiced. 

Reaching this threshold means that you considered: 

the facts the context the money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing indicators the sanctions evasion characteristics related to a fnancial transaction 

After having reviewed this information, you concluded that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that this particular fnancial transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence. It also means that you are able to demonstrate and articulate your suspicion of money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing in such a way that another individual with similar knowledge, experience, or training would likely reach the same conclusion based on a review of the same information. 

Many factors will support your assessment and conclusion that a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence has possibly occurred. These factors, along with an explanation of your assessment, should be included in the narrative section of the Suspicious Transaction Report, specifcally, the Details of suspicion section. 

The reasonable grounds to suspect threshold may be better understood when you have an understanding of other thresholds: 

simple suspicion reasonable grounds to believe 

Simple suspicion is a lower threshold than reasonable grounds to suspect and is synonymous with a "gut feeling" or "hunch". In other words, simple suspicion means that you have a feeling that something is unusual or suspicious, but do not have any facts, context or money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing indicators to support that feeling or to reasonably conclude that a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence has occurred. Simple suspicion could prompt you to assess related transactions to see if there is any additional information that would support or confrm your suspicion. 

Reasonable grounds to believe is a higher threshold than reasonable grounds to suspect and is beyond what is required to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report. Reasonable grounds to believe means that there are verifed facts that support the probability that a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence has occurred. In other words, there is enough evidence to support a reasonable and trained person to believe, not just suspect, that a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence has occurred. For example, law enforcement must reach reasonable grounds to believe that criminal activity has occurred before they can obtain judicial authorizations, such as a production order. 

If you are in receipt of a production order from law enforcement related to a predicate offence, you must perform an assessment of the facts, context, and money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing indicators to determine whether you have reasonable grounds to suspect that a particular transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence. 

For an overview of the different thresholds, see Figure 1: Threshold for suspicion.

### 4. When to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report 

You must submit the Suspicious Transaction Report to FINTRAC as soon as practicable after you have completed measures that enable you to establish that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction or attempted transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence. 

Note: There is no monetary threshold associated with the reporting of a suspicious transaction. 

#### Measures you can take to establish the reasonable grounds to suspect threshold 

The measures you can take to establish that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction or attempted transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence include the following: 

screening for and identifying suspicious transactions assessing the facts and context surrounding the suspicious transaction linking money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing indicators to your assessment of the facts and context 

explaining your grounds for suspicion in a Suspicious Transaction Report, where you articulate how the facts, context and money laundering and terrorist activity fnancing indicators allowed you to reach your grounds for suspicion 

Your measures must be described in your compliance policies and procedures. 

##### What is a fact 

A fact, for the purpose of completing a suspicious Transaction Report, is defned as an event, action, occurrence or element that exists or is known to have happened or existed. It cannot be an opinion. 

For example: 

Facts about a transaction could include the date, time, location, amount or type. 

Facts known to a reporting entity could include account details, particular business lines, a client's fnancial history or information about a person or entity (for example, that the person has been convicted of a designated offence or is the subject of a production order, or that an entity is being investigated for fraud or any other indictable offence). 

##### What is context 

Context, for the purpose of completing a Suspicious Transaction Report, is defned as information that clarifes the circumstances or explains a situation or transaction. This type of information is essential to differentiate between what may be suspicious and what may be reasonable in a given scenario. 

You may observe or understand the context of a transaction through: 

a general awareness of the events occurring in a person or entity's business environment or community 

your knowledge of the typical fnancial activities found within your business regular know your client activities (for example, verifying the identity of persons and entities, their occupation or business, how they generate their wealth, their typical or expected transactional behaviours) 

the information obtained through the application of your risk assessment illustrative client details (for example, the fnancial background, behaviour and actions of your client) 

A transaction may not appear suspicious in and of itself. However, a review of additional contextual elements surrounding the transaction may create suspicion. Conversely, the context of a particular transaction, which may have seemed unusual or suspicious from the onset, could lead you to reassess your client's current and past transactions and conclude that they are reasonable in that circumstance. 

Your suspicion of money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing will likely materialize from your assessment of multiple elements (transactions, facts, context, and any other related information that may or may not be an indicator of money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing. When these elements are viewed together, they create a picture that will either support or negate your suspicion of the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence. 

Examples of how suspicion may arise 

##### A person: 

asks several questions about your reporting obligations to FINTRAC (context) wants to know how they can avoid their transaction being reported to FINTRAC (context) structures their amounts to avoid client identifcation or reporting thresholds (fact) keeps changing their explanation for conducting a transaction or knows few details about its purpose (context) 

##### Transactions constantly being made on behalf of another person or entity: 

a client conducts a transaction while accompanied, overseen or directed by another party (fact) 

payments to or from unrelated parties (foreign or domestic) (fact) client appears to be or states that they are acting on behalf of another party (context) 

For reporting entity sectors that deal with accounts: 

##### A person making a deposit to a personal account, where the person: 

has an income or job or account history that is not consistent with the deposit amounts (fact) keeps changing their reason for the deposit, and cannot or will not provide a reason (context) 

exhibits nervous behaviour (context) 

Transactions to a business account with the following additional elements: 

deposits to the account are made by numerous parties that are not signing authorities or employees (fact) 

the account activity involves wire transfers in and out of the country (fact), which do not ft the expected pattern for that business (context) 

##### Transactions frequently being made on behalf of another person or entity: 

multiple payments made to an account by non-account holders (fact) account is linked to seemingly unconnected parties (context) 

##### What is a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing indicator, or sanctions evasion characteristic 

Money laundering and terrorist activity fnancing indicators, and sanctions evasion characteristics are potential red fags that can initiate suspicion and indicate that something may be unusual without a reasonable explanation. Red fags typically stem from one or more facts, behaviours, patterns or other contextual factors that identify irregularities related to a client's transactions. These often present inconsistencies with what is expected or considered normal based on the facts and context you know about your client and their transactional activities. 

Criminal organizations often try to avoid the detection of money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing by using multiple concealment methods. Indicators of money laundering and terrorist activity fnancing can bring to light suspicious transactional activity, but it is your holistic assessment of facts, context and money laundering and terrorist activity fnancing indicators that will enable you to determine whether you have reached reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence. Indicators are also helpful to articulate your rationale for reaching the reasonable grounds to suspect threshold in a Suspicious Transaction Report. The explanation of how you reached your grounds for suspicion is extremely important for FINTRAC's development and disclosure of fnancial intelligence. 

For more information and examples of money laundering and terrorist activity fnancing indicators applicable to your business sector: 

Consult money laundering and terrorist fnancing indicators under All FINTRAC guidance – Transaction reporting 

FINTRAC also publishes strategic intelligence products (for example, operational alerts and briefs) that focus on the identifcation of money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing related methods, techniques, and vulnerabilities 

For information on the characteristics of fnancial transactions related to suspected sanctions evasion, consult FINTRAC’s Special Bulletin on fnancial activity associated with suspected sanctions evasion. 

##### What is "as soon as practicable" 

As soon as practicable means that you have completed the measures that have allowed you to determine that you reached the reasonable grounds to suspect threshold and as such the development and submission of that Suspicious Transaction Report must be treated as a priority. The greater the delay to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report, the greater the need for a suitable explanation. Suspicious Transaction Reports can be complex, yet you must treat them as a priority and ensure they are timely. You must also complete the measures that allowed you to conclude that you have reasonable grounds to suspect the transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence before you submit the report to FINTRAC. 

Failure to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report, or not submitting one in a timely manner, may impede FINTRAC's ability to carry out its mandate. FINTRAC expects that when you have completed your measures and determined that you have reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence, you will prioritize the submission of that Suspicious Transaction Report. 

Note: In situations involving time-sensitive information, such as suspected terrorist fnancing and threats to national security, you are encouraged, as a best practice, to expedite the submission of your Suspicious Transaction Reports. We recommend that this be included in your compliance policies and procedures.

Structure of the Suspicious Transaction Report form: Main sections and types of information for each section 

#### Form highlights 

The structure of the form allows you to include 1 or more transactions in a report. 

When entering multiple transactions into a report, you can enter transactions that have: 

the same or different transaction status (for example, a report can include completed transactions and attempted transactions), and have taken place at the same or different locations 

For each completed or attempted transaction, you must provide all of these details: 

information obtained about that transaction the details of suspicion the action you have taken in the felds provided in the Suspicious Transaction Report 

For example, if you know or obtained the following information, you must provide it in the Suspicious Transaction Report: name of the person or entity who completed or attempted to complete the transaction 

type and amount of funds, assets or virtual currency involved in the completed transaction or attempted transaction 

how the funds, assets or virtual currency were used (details of disposition) for a completed transaction or going to be used in an attempted transaction 

whether the person or entity who conducted or attempted the transaction did so on anyone else's behalf 

account details of an account involved in a completed transaction or was going to be involved in an attempted transaction 

For a completed transaction, there should be at least 1 starting action and 1 completing action. 

You must also provide the name of the benefciary to the transaction if you know or obtained this information. 

For instance, if this transaction had also been submitted to FINTRAC in a different report (LVCTR, LCTR, EFTR, CDR), you may have obtained benefciary name at that time. 

A transaction can have multiple starting actions and/or completing actions—depending on the client's instructions. 

Within each starting action, you can include multiple conductors, account holders, sources of funds or virtual currency, and third parties. 

If the conductor or third party is an entity, you can also include information about the entity's director(s), benefcial owner(s), trustee(s), settlor(s), and benefciary(s) as applicable. 

Within each completing action, you can include multiple account holders, benefciaries and other persons or entities involved in the completing action. 

For each starting action, you will need to indicate the direction of the funds, asset or virtual currency used to start the transaction as either in or out. 

The direction of the starting action is in when a client physically brings in or electronically transfers in funds, assets or virtual currency to your business to start a transaction. The direction of the starting action is out when your client requests to start a transaction with client funds, assets or virtual currency already held by or deposited at your business. 

For example: 

The direction of the starting action is in, if a client brings cash to your business to purchase a bank draft. 

The direction of the funds is out for the starting action, if a client does not bring in any funds but requests to purchase a bank draft with the client's funds already held by or deposited at your business. 

##### Important information about the number of transactions, starting actions and completing actions in a report 

You must complete the General Information section of the report and provide information for each transaction. 

Every transaction must have at least: 1 starting action, and 1 completing action (if available) 

A report can have multiple transactions and within each transaction, you can include multiple starting and completing actions. 

When completing the report, you must ensure that the information you provide refects your client's instructions and is consistent with your policies and procedures. 

Example 1 

On July 10, 2023, Ms. Green walks into branch 1 of Maple Credit Union and deposits $9,900 cash into her savings account. 

On July 11, 2023, Ms. Green walks into branch 2 of Maple Credit Union with a cheque for $20,000 and deposits $12,000 into her savings account and $8,000 into her chequing account. 

On July 12, 2023, Ms. Green walks into branch 1 of Maple Credit Union and instructs that $20,000 be withdrawn from her savings account and transferred to ABC Automotive Company's account at Hemlock Bank. 

Based on a review of facts, context and indicators, as well as their procedures to assess suspicious transactions, Maple Credit Union establishes that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transactions are related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence. 

Therefore, Maple Credit Union submits a Suspicious Transaction Report. See Figure 2.

Details of suspicion Description of facts, context and indicators that allowed Maple Credit Union to conclude that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transactions are related to the commission or attempted commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence. 

Action taken Description of action taken by Maple Credit Union. 

The Suspicious Transaction Report provides general information about Maple Credit Union and indicates that Ms. Green conducted 3 transactions: 

The frst transaction was conducted at branch 1 on July 10, 2023: 

1 starting action involving $9,900 cash coming in, and 1 completing action where $9,900 is deposited into a savings account. 

As Ms. Green is the sole account holder, she is the benefciary of this transaction. 

The second transaction was conducted at branch 2 on July 11, 2023: 

1 starting action involving a $20,000 cheque coming in, and 2 completing actions where $12,000 is deposited into a savings account and $8,000 is deposited into a chequing account. 

Ms. Green is the sole account holder for both accounts and therefore the benefciary of this transaction. 

The third transaction was conducted at branch 1 on July 12, 2023: 

1 starting action involving $20,000 funds withdrawal out, and 1 completing action—an outgoing domestic funds transfer for $20,000 where ABC Automotive Company is the benefciary. 

In the Details of suspicion section of the Suspicious Transaction Report, Maple Credit Union provides the facts, context and indicators that allowed it to conclude that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transactions are related to the commission or attempted commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence. 

In the Action taken section, Maple Credit Union describes the action it has taken.

Other requirements associated with suspicious transactions 

## In this section 

Compliance program Large cash transactions Electronic funds transfers Large virtual currency transactions Casino disbursements 

Listed person or entity property Record keeping 

Verifying the identity of persons or entities Third party determination Ministerial directives 

Voluntary self-declaration of non-compliance 

Your compliance policies and procedures must outline your process and criteria on: 

how you identify and assess Suspicious Transactions Reports submitting reports to FINTRAC 

If you have an automated or triggering system in place to detect suspicious transactions, a person may still assess the transaction(s), as a best practice, to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence, and to ensure that, in these cases, the submission of a Suspicious Transaction Report. 

Your compliance program must also include training on suspected money laundering and terrorist fnancing activities in relation to your business. 

You must also assess the effectiveness of your compliance program as a part of your two-year effectiveness review. This includes assessing how effective you are in detecting, assessing and submitting Suspicious Transaction Reports. The following are examples of how this can be done: 

Review previously submitted Suspicious Transaction Reports to ensure that you are consistent in the detection, assessment and submission of these reports. 

If certain money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing indicators have supported your suspicions of money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing, you can assess whether these indicators apply to other situations to ensure that you are not missing suspicious transactions that should be or should have been reported to FINTRAC. This approach can help you build consistency within your organization. 

Work with others in your business sector to learn how they are detecting, assessing and reaching the reasonable grounds to suspect threshold and to establish common ideas of what could be considered unusual or suspicious. 

For more information, consult FINTRAC's strategic intelligence products:

### Verifying the identity of persons and entities 

You are required to take reasonable measures to verify the identity of every person or entity that conducts or attempts to conduct a suspicious transaction. This means that you are expected to ask the client for this information unless you think doing so will tip them off to your suspicion.

For more information: 

Voluntary self-declaration of non-compliance 

## 8. Reporting subsequent suspicious transactions 

Once you have reached the reasonable grounds to suspect threshold, you must submit a Suspicious Transaction Report. If there are subsequent transactions, you must keep reporting the transactions as long as the suspicion remains. 

You are expected to periodically re-assess the client to verify that the level of suspicion has not changed. This process may be part of your documented risk assessment or ongoing monitoring. 

If you continue to report Suspicious Transaction Reports on the same person or entity, you can reference a previous Suspicious Transaction Report in the Related Report(s) section by providing all of the following information: 

the reporting entity report reference number and the reporting entity transaction reference number 

the reasonable grounds to suspect (facts, context and money laundering and terrorist fnancing indicators) that were included in the frst Suspicious Transaction Report submission any new additional information 

If you are reporting Suspicious Transaction Reports due to new facts, context, or money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing indicators revealed during your assessment of the client, you are expected to detail this new information in the Suspicious Transaction Reports. 

For example, through the course of your assessment, you may have identifed new money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing indicators, or new people or entities transacting with your client. You may choose to include that information under a separate heading in the Details of suspicion section of the Suspicious Transaction Report so that it is properly labeled as new information. 

## 9. FINTRAC's expectations for completing a Suspicious Transaction Report 

It is your responsibility to ensure that the information provided in a Suspicious Transaction Report is complete and accurate. It is also important that you submit comprehensive and high quality Suspicious Transaction Report to facilitate FINTRAC's analysis process and disclosure to recipients. 

In the narrative sections of the Suspicious Transaction Report: Details of suspicion and Action taken, it is important to avoid jargon or non-public references, such as terms and acronyms that are specifc to your organization. Please use clear, simple and concise language so that an outsider can easily understand the information that you provide. 

A variety of information is often collected as part of an assessment to determine if you are required to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report and this information is valuable to include in your report to FINTRAC. 

A well-completed Suspicious Transaction Report should consider the following questions: 

Who are the parties to the transaction? 

Provide information on: 

conductor(s) third party(ies) benefciary(ies) account holder(s) source(s) of funds or virtual currency any other person or entity involved in the transaction(s) 

Provide identifying information on the parties involved in the transaction. This could include the information you recorded to identify the conductor, as well as any information you have on the other parties to the transaction or its recipients. See the Annexes of the Methods to verify the identity of persons and entities for a summary of information that must be recorded when verifying identity. 

When possible, provide information on: 

owner(s) director(s) ofcer(s) trustee(s) settlor(s) those with signing authority 

If the transaction involves an entity, you can include information on the ownership, control and structure of the business in the Suspicious Transaction Report. 

Provide clear information about each person or entity's role in each of the fnancial transactions described. For example, it is important to know who is sending and receiving the funds and this can be elaborated in the Details of suspicion section of the Suspicious Transaction Report. 

Provide the relationships between the parties (if known). This is very helpful to FINTRAC when trying to establish networks of persons or entities suspected of being involved in the commission or attempted commission of a money laundering, terrorist activity fnancing or sanctions evasion offence. 

When was the transaction completed/attempted? If it was not completed, why not? 

Provide the facts, context and money laundering and terrorist activity fnancing indicators, or sanctions evasion characteristics regarding the transaction 

What are the fnancial instruments or mechanisms used to conduct the transaction? 

Where did this transaction take place? 

Why are the transaction(s) or attempted transaction(s) related to the commission or attempted commission of a money laundering, terrorist activity fnancing or sanctions evasion offence? 

State the money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing indicators, or sanctions evasion characteristics used to support your suspicion. 

State the suspected criminal offence related to money laundering, terrorist activity fnancing or sanctions evasion, if known. 

How did the transaction take place? 

Transactions and their details must be entered in the appropriate structured felds of the form. 

Transactions may be referenced in the narrative section if there are additional facts or context. 

Examples of structured felds where you can enter information include the following : a person's alias 

electronic transfers (such as email money transfers (EMTs) or wire transfers) including IP addresses and sender/recipient email addresses location of automated teller machine (ATM) withdrawals the ownership, control and structure of an entity the source of funds or virtual currency any related and previously submitted Suspicious Transaction Report report reference numbers and transaction reference numbers credit card activity including details of purchases (dates, amounts, retailer (online or in- store) and details of payments (dates, amounts, conductor and source of payment) 

If there are transaction details for which there is no structured feld for this information, you can include this information in the narrative section of the Suspicious Transaction Report. 

Information provided in the narrative section of the Suspicious Transaction Report can contribute greatly to FINTRAC's analysis. This includes the following types of information: 

the history the client has with you links made to other people, businesses and accounts information on the ownership, control and structure of an entity that is not already captured in the felds provided in the Suspicious Transaction Report form, particularly for any business entities that have a complex structure the intended or expected use of an account versus the activity you may have observed any other information about your interactions with the client relationships between parties to the transaction the money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing indicators or factors that assisted in forming the basis of your suspicion any information, including publicly available information and/or information from law enforcement, that made you suspect that the transaction might be related to terrorist fnancing, money laundering, or both the location where a transaction was conducted, when this location does not belong to your business—for example, the location of a white label ATM that you do not own information on any politically exposed persons, including their names, role and involvement in the transactions being reported 

any details surrounding why an attempted transaction was not completed any context or clarifcation about the information that was reported in the structured sections 

If there are multiple details for a feld, provide the detail that is specifc to the transaction. 

This may occur for some felds such as the following: 

email address telephone number 

### URL 

Username 

Device identifer number 

Internet protocol address 

For example: 

Your client Billy Bird has three email addresses (Sky@example.ca, Sky22@example.ca and 

BlueSky@example.ca.); and sends email money transfers (EMTs) to Oscar Ocean who is also your 

client. Oscar has two email addresses (Starfsh@example.ca and Whaleshark@example.ca). 

A recipient, who is not your client, has the email address, FastCar@example.ca and goes by an alias name, "Smitty". 

The email addresses that you report in a Suspicious Transaction Report will depend on the transaction 

details. 

The table below provides some transaction details and the expected email address that should be 

reported. 



| Transaction details | Email address to be reported in the Suspicious Transaction Report |
| --- | --- |
| Billy Bird sends an outgoing email money transfer (EMT) for $500 using Sky@example.ca to Oscar Ocean at Starfsh@example.ca | * - Sky@example.ca (conductor email address feld) * - Starfsh@example.ca (benefciary email address feld). |
| Billy Bird sends an outgoing email money transfer (EMT) for $900 using Sky22@example.ca to Oscar Ocean at | - Sky22@example.ca (conductor email address feld) |
| Whaleshark@example.ca. | - Whaleshark@example.ca (benefciary email address feld). |
| Billy Bird sends an outgoing email money transfer (EMT) for $1,000 using Sky22@example.ca to "Smitty" at FastCar@example.ca | * - Sky22@example.ca (conductor email address feld) * - FastCar@example.ca (benefciary email address feld). |

Any additional email addresses that you have on your client (and were not related to a specifc 

transaction) can be reported in the Details of suspicion section of the Suspicious Transaction Report. In 

the example above, you can explain in this section that your client, Billy Bird, has a third email address 

(BlueSky@example.ca) that was not used in these transactions. 

Note: If your client (conductor) is not sending an email money transfer (EMT), you should still report the client's email address that you have on fle in the conductor email address feld. If your client has more 

than one email address, the additional email addresses can be provided in the narrative section of the Suspicious Transaction Report (Details of suspicion). 

FINTRAC has been able to identify networks of suspected money launderers and terrorist fnanciers through pieces of information such as email addresses and secondary identifers (nicknames) or phone numbers. This type of information may seem insignifcant but can be very important to FINTRAC, as it may identify connections among persons, entities or crimes when compared against other FINTRAC intelligence. 

The Suspicious Transaction Report structure is intended to encourage reporting even in situations where you may not have information because the client did not provide any or asking for details might "tip off" the client to your suspicions. It is FINTRAC's expectation that if you have the information within your organization, that it be reported. 

## 10. Common Suspicious Transaction Report defciencies to avoid 

The following are examples of defciencies that FINTRAC has identifed through its assessments and other compliance activities. FINTRAC is sharing these examples to illustrate common errors that you can avoid. 

### Using a higher threshold as your basis for reporting 

You are required to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report when you have completed the measures that enable you to establish that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction is related to the commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence as explained in section 3. Reasonable grounds to believe is a higher threshold than reasonable grounds to suspect and is beyond what is required to submit a Suspicious Transaction Report. 

### Failing to list all the transactions and accounts relevant to your suspicion in the specifed felds 

You are required to report all the transactions and accounts that led to your determination that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction is related to the commission or attempted commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence in the specifed felds of the report. Providing a summary of the transactions in the narrative section (Details of suspicion) is not enough. 

### Not providing or naming all parties to the transactions when the information is available 

All parties to the transaction, including their associated information, must be provided in their corresponding structured felds if this information is available. This includes any conductors, third parties, benefciaries, account holders, sources of funds or virtual currency, and any other persons or entities involved in the transaction. 

If an entity is involved, then owners, directors, ofcers, trustees, settlors and those with signing authority should be provided as applicable. You should also specify whether the parties are known or unknown. 

This has been observed in transactions such as wire transfers that involve multiple parties. 

For example, if you are reporting a wire transfer, you should include any information you have on both the ordering client and benefciary. This could include, but is not limited to, their names, their account number and institution, their relationship, and any known identifers. FINTRAC acknowledges that this information may not always be at your disposal, but when you know it, you should provide it. 

### The information provided in the narrative section of the Suspicious Transaction Report (Details of suspicion) does not elaborate on your grounds for suspicion or link to the transaction(s) in the report 

You must explain the reason(s) for your determination that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction(s) is/(are) related to the commission or attempted commission of a money laundering or terrorist fnancing offence. This includes providing,in the narrative section of the Suspicious Transaction Report,all of the relevant facts, context and money laundering and terrorist activity fnancing indicators that are related to the transaction(s) in the report and support your suspicion. 

This defciency has been observed when a reporting entity does not articulate the reasons for their suspicion or does not explain how or why certain information is relevant to their suspicion.
