# Methods to verify the identity of persons and entities 

From: Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) 

## Overview 

This guidance came into effect on June 1, 2021. 

This guidance explains the methods that can be used by reporting entities (REs) to verify the identity of a person or an entity. 

Note: For specifc information on when to verify the identity of a person or an entity (the timing requirement) for your business sector, refer to the related guidance by business sectors. 

## Who is this guidance for 

The requirement to verify the identity of a person or an entity under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and associated Regulations applies to all reporting entities 

## 1. Meaning of verifying the identity of a person or an entity 

It means to use the methods described in this guidance to ensure that the information in an identifcation document or from other informational sources matches the information that the person or entity provided. 

Verifying identity is a foundational element of Canada's anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist fnancing regime and a key component of an RE's relationship with clients. It helps you to know your clients and to understand and assess any risk that may be associated to their transactions or activities. 

## 2. How to verify the identity of a person 

You can use any of the 5 methods described below to identify a person: 

* 1. 
	+ 2.1 Government-issued photo identifcation method
* 2. 
	+ 2.2 Credit fle method
* 3. 
	+ 2.3 Dual-process method
* 4. 
	+ 2.4 Afliate or member method
* 5. 
	+ 2.5 Reliance method
	+ 2.1 Government-issued photo identifcation method You may verify the identity of a person by referring to a government-issued photo identifcation document.Footnote 1 To do so, the document must: 
	
	be authentic, valid and current;Footnote 2 be issued by a federal, provincial or territorial government (or by a foreign government if it is equivalent to a Canadian document); indicate the person's name; include a photo of the person; include a unique identifying number; and match the name and appearance of the person being identifed. 
	
	Photo identifcation documents issued by municipal governments, Canadian or foreign, are not acceptable. See Annex 4 for examples of acceptable government-issued photo identifcation documents. 
	
	You can determine whether a government-issued photo identifcation document is authentic, valid and current by viewing it in person, and by looking at the characteristics of the original physical document and its security features (or markers, as applicable) in the presence of the person being identifed. This will allow you to be satisfed that the identifcation document is authentic, as issued by the competent authority (federal, provincial, or territorial government), valid (unaltered, not counterfeit) and current (not expired). 
	
	Using the government-issued photo identifcation method if a person is not physically present 
	
	You may use the government-issued photo identifcation method if a person is not physically present, but you must have a process in place to authenticate the government-issued photo identifcation document. For instance, you could assess a document by using a technology capable of determining the document's authenticity. For example, you could: 
	
	ask a person to scan their government-issued photo identifcation document using the camera on their mobile phone or electronic device; and use a technology to compare the features of the government-issued photo identifcation document against known characteristics (for example, size, texture, character spacing, raised lettering, format, design), security features (for example, holograms, barcodes, magnetic strips, watermarks, embedded electronic chips) or markers (for example, logos, symbols) to be satisfed that it is an authentic document as issued by the competent authority (federal, provincial, or territorial government). 
	
	When a person is not physically present, you must still determine whether the authenticated government-issued photo identifcation document is valid and current, and that the name and photo are those of the person providing the document. For example, you could: 
	
	participate in a live video chat session with the person and compare the name and the features of the live video image to the name and photo on the authentic government-issued photo identifcation document; or 
	
	ask the person to take a "selfe" photo using the camera on their mobile phone or electronic device, and use an application to apply facial recognition technology to compare the features of that "selfe" to the photo on the authentic government-issued photo identifcation document. You would also need a process to compare the name on the government-issued photo identifcation document with the name provided by the person. 
	
	Note: It is not enough to only view a person and their government-issued photo identifcation document through a video conference or another type of virtual application. 
	
	Your compliance program's policies and procedures must describe the processes you follow to determine whether a government-issued photo identifcation document is authentic, whether the client is present or not, and how you will confrm that it is valid and current. Your policies and procedures must also describe the steps you use to confrm that the name and photograph are those of the person. Your processes to determine that a government-issued photo identifcation document is authentic, valid, and current, and the verifcation step (ensuring that the name and photo match the name and appearance of the person), do not need to happen at the same time. It is up to you to determine the timing, but you must complete both steps. 
	
	Record keeping requirements for the government-issued photo identifcation method 
	
	If you use the government-issued photo identifcation method, you must record:Footnote 3 
	
	the person's name; the date on which you verifed the person's identity; the type of document used (for example, driver's licence, passport, etc.); the unique identifying number of the document used; the jurisdiction (province or state) and country of issue of the document; and the expiry date of the document, if available (if this information appears on the document or card, you must record it).
	+ 2.2 Credit fle method You may verify the identity of a person by referring to information that is in their credit fle.Footnote 4 To do so, the credit fle must: 
	
	contain information that is valid and current;Footnote 5 be from a Canadian credit bureau (credit fles from foreign credit bureaus are not acceptable); have been in existence for at least three years; contain information that is derived from more than one source (i.e. more than one tradeline); and match the name, address and date of birth of the person being identifed. 
	
	A credit fle provides a rating on a person's ability to repay loans; however, it is possible to request a credit fle to verify a person's identifying information that does not include a credit assessment. You do not need a credit assessment to verify the identity of a person. Equifax Canada and TransUnion Canada are Canadian credit bureaus that provide credit fle information for identifcation purposes. 
	
	To use the credit fle method, you must conduct the search at the time you are verifying the person's identity. A person cannot provide you with a copy of their credit fle, nor can a previously obtained credit fle be used. 
	
	It is acceptable to use an automated system to match the person's information with the information in the person's credit fle. You may also refer to a third party vendor to provide you with valid and current information from the person's credit fle. A third party vendor is a business that is authorized by a Canadian credit bureau to provide access to Canadian credit information. 
	
	If any of the information provided by the person (name, address or date of birth) does not match the information in the credit fle, you cannot use that credit fle to verify the identity of the person. You will need to use another credit fle from a different provider (credit bureau or third party vendor) or use a different method (for example, the government-issued photo identifcation method or the dual-process method) to verify the person's identity. 
	
	On occasion, information found in the credit fle may contain a variation on the name or a discrepancy in the address that was provided to you by the person. In these instances, you must determine whether the information in the credit fle matches the information provided by the person. For example: 
	
	If there is a slight typo in the address or name, you may determine that the information still matches what the person provided. 
	
	If there is a discrepancy in their date of birth, it is more likely that you will determine that the information does not match. 
	
	In this case, if this is your determination, you cannot rely on the information in the credit fle for identifcation purposes. You will need to use another credit fle from a different provider (credit bureau or third party vendor) or use a different method (for example, the government-issued photo identifcation method or the dual-process method) to verify the person's identity. 
	
	If there are multiple addresses in the credit fle, it is possible that the address the person provided to you is not the primary address in the credit fle but it does appear in the credit fle as a secondary address. If this is the case, you can still meet your requirements for ensuring that the information matches what the person provided. 
	
	Record keeping requirements for the credit fle method 
	
	If you use the credit fle method, you must record:Footnote 6 
	
	the person's name; the date you consulted or searched the credit fle; the name of the Canadian credit bureau or third party vendor as the source holding the credit fle; and 
	
	the person's credit fle number. 
	
	Your compliance program's policies and procedures must describe the processes you will follow to verify a person's identity using the credit fle method and how you will ensure that the information is valid and current. It should also include the steps you will take if the information is not valid and current (for example, search a different credit fle, use another method, stop the transaction, etc.).
	+ 2.3 Dual-process method You may verify the identity of a person by using the dual-process method, which consists of doing any two of the following:Footnote 7 
	
	referring to information from a reliable source that includes the person's name and address and confrming that the name and address are those of the person; referring to information from a reliable source that includes the person's name and date of birth, and confrming that the name and date of birth are those of the person; or referring to information that includes the person's name and confrms that they have a deposit account, a prepaid payment product account , or a credit card or other loan account with a fnancial entity, and confrming that information. 
	
	The information you refer to must be valid and currentFootnote 8 and come from two different reliable sources. This information could be found in statements, letters, certifcates, forms or other information sources that can be provided through an original version or by another version of the information's original format such as a fax, a photocopy, a scan, or an electronic image. For example, you can rely on a fax, photocopy, scan or electronic image of a government-issued photo identifcation document as one of the two pieces of information required to verify a person's identity. 
	
	You cannot use the same source for the two categories of information you choose to verify a person's identity.Footnote 9 For example, you cannot rely on a bank statement from Bank A that includes the person's name and address and another bank statement from Bank A that includes the person's name and confrms that the person holds a deposit account, as Bank A would be the same source of both categories of information. You can, however, refer to a bank statement from Bank A that contains the person's name and confrms that the person holds a deposit account, and rely on an electronic image of a driver's licence to confrm the person's name and address. 
	
	For further precision, the possible combinations for this method include: 
	
	Referring to information from one reliable source that includes the person's name and address and confrming that this matches the information provided by the person, and referring to information from a different reliable source that includes the person's name and date of birth and confrming that this matches the information provided by the person. 
	
	OR 
	
	Referring to information from one reliable source that includes the person's name and address and confrming that this matches the information provided by the person, and referring to information from a different reliable source that includes the person's name and a fnancial account(specifcally, a deposit account, a prepaid payment product account, a credit card account or a loan account) and confrming this information. 
	
	OR 
	
	Referring to information from one reliable source that includes the person's name and date of birth and confrming that this matches the information provided by the person, and referring to information from a different reliable source that includes the person's name and a fnancial account(specifcally, a deposit account, a prepaid payment product account, a credit card account or a loan account) and confrming this information. 
	
	Note: If the information does not match the information provided by the person, you cannot rely on it. For example, it is not acceptable to rely on information if the account number or number that is associated with the information is truncated or redacted. On occasion, information from a source may contain a variation on the name of the client or a typo in the client's address. In these instances, you must determine whether the information matches the information provided by the person. If it is a slight typo in the address or a misspelled name, you may determine that the information still matches what the person provided. However, in the case of an incorrect date of birth, it is more likely that you will determine that the information does not match. In this case, you cannot rely on the information from this source for identifcation purposes. You must obtain information from a different source under the dual-process method or use a different method (for example, the government-issued photo identifcation method or the credit fle method) to verify the person's identity. 
	
	Reliable source of information 
	
	A reliable source of information is an originator or issuer of information that you trust. To be considered reliable, the source should be well known and considered reputable. For example, a reliable source could be the federal, provincial, territorial or municipal levels of government, Crown corporations, federally regulated fnancial institutions, or utility providers. Social media is not an acceptable source of information to verify a person's identity. Also, the source cannot be the person whose identity is being verifed, nor you, the RE who is verifying identity.Footnote 10 See Annex 5 for a table of examples of reliable sources of information for the dual-process method. 
	
	How to use a credit fle under the dual-process method 
	
	A Canadian credit fle can be used as one of the two pieces of information required to verify the identity of a person under the dual-process method. Specifcally, it can be used to confrm the person's name and address, name and date of birth, or to confrm the person's name and confrm that the person has a credit card account or a loan account. If you use a credit fle as one of the information pieces for the dual-process method, it must have existed for at least six months.Footnote 11 
	
	Information from a second source, for example, a property tax assessment, must be used to confrm the second category of information. In this instance, the two reliable sources are the Canadian credit bureau that provided the credit fle information and the municipal government that issued the property tax assessment. The information from these two sources must match the information provided by the person. 
	
	You can also refer to information from a Canadian credit bureau if it acts as an aggregator that compiles information from different reliable sources (often referred to as tradelines). In this instance, the Canadian credit bureau must provide you with information from two independent tradelines where each tradeline confrms one of the two categories of information required to verify the identity of a person under this method. In this instance, each tradeline is a distinct source; the credit bureau is not the source. 
	
	The tradelines cannot be your own, as the RE verifying the person's identity, and each tradeline must originate from a different reliable source (for example, a federally regulated fnancial institution, a utility service provider, etc.). 
	
	Record keeping requirements for the dual-process method 
	
	If you use the dual-process method to verify a person's identity, you must record:Footnote 12 
	
	the person's name; the date you verifed the information; the name of the two different reliable sources that were used to verify the identity of the person; the type of information referred to (for example, a utility statement, a bank statement, a marriage licence); and 
	
	the number associated with the information (for example, account number or if there is no account number, a number that is associated with the information, which could be a reference number or certifcate number, etc.). If you use information aggregated by a Canadian credit bureau and receive information from two distinct sources (tradelines), you must record the account number or number associated to each tradeline, not the aggregator (credit bureau) number. 
	
	Your compliance program's policies and procedures must describe the processes you follow when using the dual-process method to verify a person's identity and how you will ensure that the information is valid and current.
	+ 2.4 Afliate or member method You may verify the identity of a person by confrming that one of the following entities previously verifed the person's identity: 
	
	an afliate of yours that is an RE referred to in any of paragraphs 5(a) to (g) of the PCMLTFA;Footnote 13 
	
	a foreign afliate of yours that carries out activities outside of Canada that are similar to the activities of an RE referred to in any of paragraphs 5(a) to (g) of the PCMLTFA;Footnote 14 or a fnancial entity that is subject to the PCMLTFA and isa member of yourfnancial services cooperative or credit union central.Footnote 15 
	
	You must confrm that the name, address, and date of birth in the afliate or member's records match the information provided by the person whose identity is being verifed.Footnote 16 
	
	The afliate or member must have previously verifed the person's identity by using the government- issued photo identifcation method, the credit fle method or the dual-process method presented in this Guidance. If the afliate or member verifed the identity of the person prior to June 1, 2021, they must have done so in accordance with the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations (PCMLTFR), by using the methods that were in place at the time.Footnote 17 
	
	If you have any concerns about the methods or information that the afliate or member used to verify the person's identity, you should re-verify their identity,Footnote 18 as you have the responsibility for ensuring the person's identity has been verifed. 
	
	Note: Financial services cooperatives or credit union centrals act on behalf of a membership composed of certain fnancial entities and can provide fnancial services to that group. 
	
	Record keeping requirements for the afliate or member method 
	
	When you verify the identity of a person by confrming that an afliate or a fnancial entity that is a member of your fnancial services cooperative or credit union central previously verifed their identity, you must record:Footnote 19 
	
	the person's name; the date on which you verifed the identity of the person; the name of the afliate or the member that previously verifed the person's identity; the method (government-issued photo identifcation, credit fle or dual-process) that the afliate or the member used to verify the person's identity; and the information that the afliate or the member recorded based on the method used (this includes the name of the person, the date the afliate or member verifed identity, and all the other information required to be kept by them for the method used). 
	
	Note: If the afliate or the member verifed the identity of the person in accordance with the methods that were in place prior to June 1, 2021, you must still record the information listed above, but include the method they used in accordance with the PCMLTFR as it read at the time, and the information that was required to be recorded for that method.Footnote 20 
	
	Your compliance program's policies and procedures must describe the processes you follow when using the afliate or member method to verify a person's identity.
	+ 2.5 Reliance method You may verify the identity of a person by relying on measures that were previously taken by: 
	
	another RE(person or entity that is referred to in section 5 of the PCMLTFA);Footnote 21 or an entity that is afliated with you or with another RE and carries out activities outside of Canada that are similar to those of a person or entity referred to in any of paragraphs 5(a) to (g) of the PCMLTFA(an afliated foreign entity).Footnote 22 
	
	To rely on measures previously taken by an afliated foreign entity, you must be satisfed, after considering the risk of a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence in the foreign state in which it carries out its activities, that:Footnote 23 
	
	the afliated foreign entity has policies in place similar to the record keeping, verifying identity, and compliance program requirements under the PCMLTFA, including the requirement to develop and apply policies to assess, in the course of their activities, the risk of a money laundering offence or a terrorist activity fnancing offence, and the requirement to take enhanced measures where the risk has been identifed as high; and the afliated foreign entity's compliance with those policies is subject to the supervision of a competent authority under the legislation of that foreign state. 
	
	To rely on measures previously taken by another RE or an afliated foreign entity to verify the identity of a person, you must:Footnote 24 
	
	as soon as feasible, obtain from the other RE or afliated foreign entity the information that was confrmed as being that of the person, and be satisfed that: 
	
	the information is valid and current; and the other RE or afliated foreign entity verifed the person's identity using the government- issued photo identifcation method, the credit fle method or the dual-process method, or if the other RE or afliated foreign entity verifed the person's identity prior to June 1, 2021, that they did so in accordance with the PCMLTFR, by using the methods that were in place at the time; and 
	
	have a written agreement or arrangement with the other RE or afliated foreign entity that upon request requires them to provide you, as soon as feasible, with all of the information that they referred to in order to verify the person's identity. 
	
	Record keeping requirements for the reliance method 
	
	If you rely on another RE or an afliated foreign entity to verify the identity of a person, you must keep a record of:Footnote 25 
	
	the person's name; the written agreement or arrangement with the other RE or afliated foreign entity for the purpose of verifying a person's identity; and the information that the other RE or afliated foreign entity referred to in order to verify the identity the person. 
	
	Your compliance program's policies and procedures must describe the processes you follow when using the reliance method to verify a person's identity and how you will ensure that the information is valid and current.
## 3. Using an agent or a mandatary to verify the identity of a person on your behalf 

You may verify the identity of a person by using an agent or mandatary to carry out the verifcation on your behalf, in accordance with the government-issued photo identifcation method, the credit fle method, or the dual-process method.Footnote 26 

You may rely on the measures that were previously taken by an agent or mandatary to verify the person's identity, if the agent or mandatary was:Footnote 27 

acting in their own capacity at the time, whether or not they were required to use the methods in accordance with the PCMLTFR; or 

acting as an agent or mandatary under a written agreement or arrangement that was entered into with another RE, for the purposes of verifying a person's identity using either the government- issued photo identifcation method, the credit fle method or the dual-process method, or if the measures were taken prior to June 1, 2021, using the methods in accordance with the PCMLTFR that were in place at the time. 

To use an agent or mandatary to verify the identity of a person you must:Footnote 28 have a written agreement or arrangement in place with the agent or mandatary before you use them;Footnote 29 

obtain, as soon as feasible, all of the information that the agent or mandatary referred to in order to verify the person's identity, and the information that the agent or mandatory confrmed as being that of the person;Footnote 30 and 

be satisfed that: the information that the agent or mandatary confrmed as being that of the person is valid and current, and 

the person's identity was verifed using the government-issued photo identifcation method, the credit fle method or the dual-process method, or, if the person's identity was verifed prior to June 1, 2021, using the methods in accordance with the PCMLTFR in place at the time.Footnote 31 

### Example 1 — Acceptable 

Jane Smith would like to open an account with you. Your agent—with whom you have a written agreement for this purpose—verifed Jane Smith's identity in 2019 using the government-issued photo identifcation method, by referring to her driver's licence, which expired in February 2021. In 2019, Jane Smith's name and appearance matched the name and photograph on the driver's licence, and the document was determined to be authentic, valid and current, therefore, her identity was verifed by the agent in accordance with the method. Jane's name and appearance have not changed. When you obtain the information from the agent, you are satisfed that the information the agent confrmed as being Jane's (her name and photo) is still valid and current and is therefore acceptable. It does not matter that her licence (the identifcation document used by the agent) has expired, as it is the information that you must be satisfed is valid and current, not the document. 

### Example 2 — Not acceptable 

Jane Smith (maiden name — Jane Rogers) would like to carry out a transaction for which you must verify her identity. Your agent—with whom you have a written agreement for this purpose—verifed Jane Rogers' identity in 2019 using the government-issued photo identifcation method, by referring to her driver's licence, which has not yet expired. In 2019, Jane Rogers' name and appearance matched the name and photograph on the driver's licence, and the document was determined to be authentic, valid and current, therefore, her identity was verifed by the agent in accordance with the method. However, although the licence has not yet expired, it is not acceptable to rely on the information from the agent now because the agent's information is about Jane Rogers, and this does not match the name of your client who is now Jane Smith, so the information provided by the agent is not valid and current. 

### Example 3 — Not acceptable 

Jane Smith would like to carry out a transaction for which you must verify her identity. Your agent—with whom you have a written agreement for this purpose—verifed Jane Smith's identity in 2019 by referring to her driver's licence, which expired in 2018. In 2019, because Jane Smith's driver's licence had expired, her identity was not verifed in accordance with the government-issued photo identifcation method. As such, it is not acceptable to rely on the information from the agent. 

### Record keeping requirements when using an agent or a mandatary 

When you verify the identity of a person by using an agent or mandatary, you must keep a record of:Footnote 32 

the person's name; the written agreement or arrangement with the agent or mandatary for verifying a person's identity; and 

all of the information the agent or mandatary referred to in order to verify the identity of the person, and the information that the agent or mandatary confrmed as being that of the person (this includes, as applicable, information that is required to be kept in the record for the method used). 

Note: As an RE it is your responsibility to meet your client identifcation requirements under the PCMLTFA and associated Regulations, even when you use an agent or mandatary to verify the identity of a person on your behalf, or when you rely on the measures previously taken by an agent or mandatary to verify a person's identity. 

For example, if your agent verifes the identity of a person using the government-issued photo identifcation method but they don't refer to an authentic, valid and current photo identifcation document issued by a federal, provincial or territorial government, or keep the required records after verifying the person's identity, you are still responsible. Specifcally, it is your responsibility to ensure that the agent is verifying client identity and keeping the required records in accordance with the PCMLTFA and associated Regulations. 

Your compliance program's policies and procedures must describe the processes you follow when you rely on an agent or mandatary to verify a person's identity and how you will ensure that the information is valid and current. 

## 4. Verifying a person's identity if it has been previously verifed 

You do not need to verify a person's identity for subsequent transactions or activities, as required, if you have already verifed the identity of the person using:Footnote 33 

one of the methods explained in this guidance; or the methods specifed in the PCMLTFR prior to June 1, 2021 as it read at the time, and have kept the required record. 

You must not have doubts about the information that was previously used to verify the person's identity. If you have doubts, you must verify their identity again using the methods explained in this guidance.Footnote 34 

Note: In the context of a business merger or acquisition, you are not required to re-identify the acquired clients if their identities were verifed in accordance with the methods in the PCMLTFR at the time the verifcation took place. As a best practice, you are encouraged to review and update client information (for example, name, address, occupation, etc.), in accordance with your risk assessment process. The acquired clients become the responsibility of the acquiring entity which must ensure compliance with the PCMLTFA and associated Regulations. This includes reviewing any money laundering or terrorist fnancing risks that may be associated with these clients. 

## 5. How to identify a child 

If a child is under 12 years of age, you must verify the identity of one parent, guardian or tutor and record the parent, guardian or tutor's information.Footnote 35 You can rely on the information provided by the parent, guardian or tutor in order to record the child's identifcation details. 

If a child is between 12 and 15 years of age, you can verify their identity by using any of the methods. If this is not possible due to a lack of identifcation information, you may use a variation of the dual- process method that allows you to: 

Refer to one reliable source of information that includes the name and address of the child's parent, guardian, or tutor;Footnote 36 and 

Refer to a second reliable source that includes the child's name and date of birth. 

For example, if the child has a passport you may be able to use it to verify their identity under the government-issued photo identifcation method. If not, you could rely on the parent's driver's licence to verify the parent's name and their common address, and the child's birth certifcate to verify the child's name and date of birth. 

## 6. 

How to verify the identity of a person who does not have any identity verifcation documentation or information for a retail deposit account Added on February 22, 2023 

In the case of opening a retail deposit account, if a bank cannot verify a person's identity in accordance with one of the methods outlined above, they would still be in compliance with their anti-money laudering/anti-terrorist fnancing obligations if they opened the account in a way that meets the conditions set out in subsections 627.17(1) and (3) of the Bank Act. 

Note: The Bank Act applies to banks, authorized foreign banks and federal credit unions, which are defned as banks under the Act. 

For reasons beyond a person's control, they may face barriers in meeting requirements where they must provide proper identifcation documentation or information. This may be the case for vulnerable populations with barriers to obtaining proper identifcation such as survivors of human trafcking or victims of domestic abuse. 

In specifc circumstances, where a person does not have the proper identifcation documentation or information, a bank must: 

follow the measures as defned by the Bank Act and any bulletins published by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada that further defne the measures to be taken document in their compliance policies and procedures the types of circumstances where their organization would follow the Bank Act for verifcation of identifcation ensure that the banking products provided to the individual opening the account are limited to a basic retail deposit account until which time the account holder returns with the proper form of identifcation as specifed in paragraphs 105(1)(a) to (e) of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations verify the person's identity using the appropriate form of identifcation as specifed in paragraphs 105(1)(a) to (e) of the Regulations, within 6 to 12 months, or as described in their risk-based approach and keep appropriate records continue to follow their customer due diligence and "know your client" processes, ensure ongoing monitoring activities are conducted as per the bank's risk assessment of the client and monitor transactions to ensure that the fnancial activity and use of associated products/services aligns with what is known about the person. 

Note: The risk-based approach must refect what is known about the client (i.e., their profle and individual circumstances including the fact that alternate identifcation was accepted), and that ongoing monitoring should then be commensurate to the risk profle of the client. 

When FINTRAC undertakes compliance activities to ensure reporting entities are meeting their obligations, and observes that this process is used, we will: 

verify that you have documented policies and procedures that articulate the steps your organization takes to ensure that they are meeting this requirement ensure that the procedures are also followed in practice verify that your risk assessment takes into account these circumstances, ensures that these individuals are identifed within a reasonable timeframe (i.e., 6 to 12 months) and that you are able to demonstrate that you are fulflling these requirements. 

## 7. How to verify the identity of an entity 

You can use any of the 3 methods described below to verify the identity of an entity: 

* 1. 
	+ 7.1 Confrmation of existing method
* 2. 
	+ 7.2 Reliance method
* 3. 
	+ 7.3 Simplifed identifcation method While an entity can be a corporation, a trust, a partnership, a fund, or an unincorporated association or organization, corporations are subject to different requirements than other entities (as explained below).

### Corporation 

#### 7.1 Confrmation of existence method 

To verify the identity of a corporation, you may refer to:Footnote 37 

a certifcate of incorporation; a record that has to be fled annually under provincial securities legislation; or the most recent version of any other record that confrms the corporation's existence and contains its name and address and the names of its directors, such as a certifcate of active corporate status, the corporation's published annual report signed by an audit frm, or a letter or notice of assessment for the corporation from a municipal, provincial, territorial or federal government. 

The record you refer to must be authentic, valid and current.Footnote 38 

You may obtain a corporation's name and address and the names of its directors from a publicly accessible database, such as a provincial or federal database like the Corporations Canada database, or a corporation search and registration service through subscription. 

When a corporation is a securities dealer, you do not need to confrm the names of its directors when you confrm its existence.Footnote 39 

### Entity 

To verify the identity of an entity other than a corporation, you may refer to:Footnote 40 

a partnership agreement; articles of association; or the most recent version of any other record that confrms its existence and contains its name and address. 

### Record keeping requirements when verifying the identity of a corporation or other entity 

If you refer to a paper record or an electronic version of a record, you must keep the record or a copy of it. 

If the electronic version of the record that you refer to is contained in a database that is accessible to the public, you must keep a record that includes the corporation or other entity's registration number, the type of record referred to and the source of the electronic version of the record.Footnote 42 

Your compliance program's policies and procedures must describe the processes you follow when using the confrmation of existence method to verify the identity of corporations and other entities, and how you will ensure that the information is authentic, valid and current. 

#### 7.2 Reliance method 

You may verify the identity of a corporation or other entity by relying on the measures that were previously taken by: 

another RE(a person or entity that is referred to in section 5 of the PCMLTFA);Footnote 43 or an entity that is afliated with you or with another RE and carries out activities outside of Canada that are similar to those of a person or entity referred to in any of paragraphs 5(a) to (g) of the PCMLTFA (an afliated foreign entity).Footnote 44 

### Measures previously taken by an afliated foreign entity 

To rely on measures previously taken by an afliated foreign entity, you must be satisfed, after considering the risk of a money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offence in the foreign state in which it carries out its activities, that:Footnote 45 

the afliated foreign entity has policies in place similar to the record keeping, verifying identity, and compliance program requirements under the PCMLTFA, including the requirement to develop and apply policies to assess, in the course of their activities, the risk of a money laundering offence or a terrorist activity fnancing offence, and the requirement to take enhanced measures where the risk has been identifed as high; and the afliated foreign entity's compliance with those policies is subject to the supervision of a competent authority under the legislation of that foreign state. 

### Measures previously taken by another reporting entity or an afliated foreign entity 

To rely on the measures previously taken by another RE or an afliated foreign entity to verify the identity of a corporation or other entity, you must:Footnote 46 as soon as feasible, obtain from the other RE or afliated foreign entity the information that was used to confrm the identity of the corporation or other entity, as the case may be, and be satisfed that: 

the information is valid and current; and for a corporation, its identity was verifed by the other RE or afliated foreign entity by referring to a record as described in the confrmation of existence method above, or if the measures to verify the corporation's identity were performed prior to June 1, 2021, that the other RE or afliated foreign entity confrmed the corporation's existence and ascertained its name, address, and the names of its directors in accordance with the methods in the PCMLTFR as they read at that time;Footnote 47 and for an entity other than a corporation, its identity was verifed by the other RE or afliated foreign entity by referring to a record as described in the confrmation of existence method above, or if the measures to verify the entity's identity were performed prior to June 1, 2021, the other RE or afliated foreign entity confrmed the entity's existence in accordance with the methods in the PCMLTFR as they read at that time;Footnote 48 and 

have a written agreement or arrangement in place with the other RE or afliated foreign entity that upon request requires them to provide you, as soon as feasible, with all of the information that they referred to in order to verify the identity of the corporation or other entity, as the case may be.Footnote 49 

Your compliance program's policies and procedures must describe the processes you will follow when using the reliance method to verify the identity of corporations and other entities and how you will ensure that the information is valid and current. 

#### 7.3 Simplifed identifcation method 

If you are an RE that isreferred to in any of paragraphs 5(a) to (g) of the PCMLTFA, you may use the simplifed identifcation method to meet your obligation to verify the identity of a corporation or other entity. Specifcally, you are deemed to comply with your requirement to verify the identity of a corporation or other entity if, based on your risk assessment, you consider there is a low risk of a money laundering offence or terrorist activity fnancing offence, and if:Footnote 50 

the corporation or other entity whose identity is being verifed: 

* 1. is referred to in any of paragraphs 5(a) to (g) of the PCMLTFA;
* 2. is a foreign corporation or entity that carries out activities that are similar to those of an entity referred to in any of paragraph 5(a) to (g) of the PCMLTFA;
* 3. administers a pension or investment fund that is regulated under the legislation of a foreign state and that either is created by a foreign government or is subject to the supervision of a competent authority under the legislation of that foreign state;
* 4. is one whose shares are traded on a Canadian stock exchange or a stock exchange designated under subsection 262(1) of the Income Tax Act;
* 5. is a subsidiary of a corporation or an entity that is referred to in paragraphs a. to d. in this section, and is one whose fnancial statements are consolidated with the fnancial statements of that corporation or entity;
* 6. is an institution or agency of, or in the case of a corporation, is owned by, the government of a foreign state; or
* 7. is a public service body, as defned in subsection 123(1) of the Excise Tax Act; and

you are satisfed that, within the applicable time period for which you had to verify identity, as explained in the sector-specifc guidance on When to verify the identity of persons and entities, the corporation or other entity exists and that every person who deals with you on behalf of the corporation or other entity is authorized by it to do so. 

If you subsequently consider, based on your risk assessment, that the risk of a money laundering offence or terrorist activity fnancing offence has increased and is no longer low then you must, as soon as feasible, verify the identity of the corporation or other entity, as the case may be, by referring to the appropriate records, as explained in section 7.1, Confrmation of existence method. 

### Record keeping requirements for the simplifed identifcation method 

If you use the simplifed identifcation method to verify the identity of a corporation or other entity, you must keep a record that sets out: 

the grounds for considering there is a low risk of a money laundering offence or terrorist activity fnancing offence; and 

the information obtained about the corporation or other entity, as the case may be, and about the persons that assure you that the corporation or other entity exists and that the persons you deal with are authorized to act on behalf of the corporation or the entity.Footnote 52 

Your compliance program's policies and procedures must describe the processes you follow when using the simplifed identifcation method to verify the identity of corporations and other entities. 

## 8. Verifying the identity of an entity if it has been previously verifed 

You do not need to verifythe identity of a corporation or other entity for subsequent transactions or activities, as required, if you have already verifed their identity by using: 

One of the methods explained in this guidance; or in the case of an entity, you confrmed the entity's existence in accordance with the PCMLTFR, and you complied with the related record keeping provisions, as they read at the time prior to June 1, 2021; or in the case of a corporation, you confrmed the corporation's existence and ascertained its name and address and the names of its directors in accordance with PCMLTFR, and you complied with the related record keeping provisions, as they read at the time prior to June 1, 2021 

You must not have doubts about the information that was previously used to verify the identity of the corporation or other entity. If you have doubts, you must verify identity again using the methods explained in this guidance.Footnote 54 

## 9. Restrictions on the use of personal information 

The use of personal information in Canadian commercial activities is protected by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), or by similar provincial legislation. You have to inform clients about the collection of their personal information. However, you do not have to inform them when you include their personal information in the reports you are required to submit to FINTRAC. 

The Ofce of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada can provide further guidance, and has created a Question and Answer document about PIPEDA and the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act, to help clarify your responsibilities under PIPEDA.

	+ b. Large virtual currency (VC) transactions You must verify the identity of every person or entity from which you receive VC in an amount equivalent to $10,000 or more when the transaction takes place.Footnote 4 This includes a situation where you are deemed to have received VC because you have authorized another person or entity to receive it on your behalf.Footnote 5 
	
	\*\*Note: This obligation is subject to the 24-hour rule.
	+ c. Suspicious transactions You must take reasonable measures to verify the identity of every person or entity that conducts or attempts to conduct a suspicious transaction, regardless of the transaction amount, and including transactions that would normally be exempt from client identifcation requirements, before sending a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR).Footnote 7
	+ d. Issuing or redeeming money orders, traveller's cheques or other similar negotiable instruments of $3,000 or more You must verify the identity of every person who requests that you issue or redeem money orders, traveller's cheques or similar negotiable instruments of $3,000 or more when the transaction is being requested. Footnote 8
	+ e. Initiating an international electronic funds transfer (EFT)—or any other EFT that is a SWIFT MT-103 message or its equivalent—of $1,000 or more You must verify the identity of every person who requests the initiation of an international EFT or any other EFT that is a SWIFT MT-103 or its equivalent, including domestic SWIFT MT-103, of $1,000 or more when the transaction is being requested.Footnote 9

	+ k. Accounts—Account holders and persons authorized to give instructions Account holders 
	
	You must verify the identity of every person, corporation, and entity other than a corporation for which you open an account.Footnote 15 You must do this before the frst transaction other than when the initial deposit is carried out.Footnote 16 
	
	Persons authorized to give instructions 
	
	You must verify the identity of every person authorized to give instructions on an account before the frst transaction, other than the initial deposit, is carried out on the account.Footnote 17 
	
	This includes verifying the identity of the individual members of a group plan account who are authorized to give instructions , when a contribution to the plan is made in respect of the member.Footnote 18 
	
	You cannot open an account for a person, corporation, or other entity if you cannot verify their identity in accordance with the Regulations.Footnote 19
	+ l. Credit card accounts—account holders You must verify the identity of every person, corporation, and other entity for which you open a credit card accountFootnote 20 before the credit card can be activated.Footnote 21 If credit cards are issued for persons other than the account holder, you must record their information if they are authorized to give instructions on an account, but you do not have to verify their identity. 
	
	For example, a parent applying for a credit card account requests that a credit card be issued on that account for their child, and that child be authorized to give instructions on that account. In this example, the parent's identity has to be verifed because the parent is the account holder, the child's identity does not need to be verifed.

	You must also verify the identity of a corporation or an entity other than a corporation that is the settlor of an institutional trust for which you are a trustee.Footnote 29 
	
	You must verify the identity of any person who is authorized to act as co-trustee of a trust.Footnote 30 If an entity is authorized to act as co-trustee of a trust, you must verify its identity and the identity of all persons authorized to give instructions on its behalf (up to three).Footnote 31 
	
	You must verify the identity of a person or an entity within 15 days after the day on which the trust company becomes the trustee.Footnote 32
## 2. What is the difference between verifying identity and keeping client identifcation information up to date? 

As part of your ongoing monitoring requirements for business relationships, you must keep client identifcation information up to date, at a frequency that will vary based on your risk assessment, and as outlined in your policies and procedures.Footnote 33 This does not require you to re-identify clients in accordance with the methods to verify identity. As explained in the ongoing monitoring guidance, the requirement is only for you to keep client identifcation information up to date. This is understood to be information that you have about your client such as their name and address. In the case of a person, this would also include, but is not limited to, the nature of their principal business or their occupation; and in the case of an entity, the nature of its principal business. 

## 3. What are the exceptions to client identifcation requirements? 

You do not have to re-identify a person or an entity if you previously did so using the methods specifed by the Regulations in place at the time, and kept the associated records, so long as you have no doubts about the information used.Footnote 34 

### Large cash transactions 

You do not have to verify the identity of a person or entity that conducts a large cash transaction if: 

you receive the cash from another FE or a public body, or from a person who is acting on behalf of a client that is an FE or a public body;Footnote 35 or the amount received is deposited to a business account or is deposited in an automated banking machine (including a quick drop or night deposit).Footnote 36 

### Large VC transactions 

You do not have to verify the identity of a person or entity that conducts a large VC transaction if you receive the VC from a client that is an FE or a public body, or from a person acting on behalf of a client that is an FE or public body.Footnote 37 

When you transfer or receive VC as compensation for the validation of a transaction that is recorded in a distributed ledger or you exchange, transfer or receive a nominal amount of VC for the sole purpose of validating another transaction or a transfer of information – you do not need to keep a large VC transaction record and do not need to verify identity.Footnote 38 

### Suspicious transactions 

You do not have to take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the person or entity that conducts or attempts to conduct a suspicious transaction if: 

you have already verifed the identity of the person or entity and have no doubts about the identifcation information;Footnote 39 or you believe that verifying the identity of the person or entity would inform them that you are submitting an STR.Footnote 40 

### EFT by credit/debit card or PPP 

Your client identifcation requirements do not apply when you carry out the following transactions for a person by means of a credit/debit card or PPP, if the benefciary has an agreement with the payment service provider that permits payments by those means for goods and services:Footnote 41 

initiate an international EFT of $1,000 or more; or are the fnal recipient of an international EFT, or of a VC transfer equivalent to $1000 or more and remit the funds to the benefciary. 

### Payment card processing activities 

Client identifcation requirements do not apply to processing credit card or PPP payments on behalf of a merchant.Footnote 42 

### Public bodies, very large corporations and trusts 

When opening an account, including a credit card account, PPP account or trust account, you do not have to verify the identity of a person or entity if it is for:Footnote 43 

a public body; a very large corporation or trust; or a subsidiary of those types of entities, if the fnancial statements of the subsidiary are consolidated with those of the public body, or very large corporation or trust. 

### Account openings 

You do not have to verify the identity of the person that opens an account, is authorized to give instructions in respect of an account, opens a credit card account, or is the settlor or co-trustee of a trust in the following circumstances:Footnote 44 

if the person already has an account with you and opens a subsequent account; if the person is authorized on a business account, so long as you have verifed the identity of at least three persons authorized to give instructions on the account. If one of the three identifed persons leaves the business, you must verify the identity of another person authorized on the account; 

an account that is opened for the sale of mutual funds where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the client's identity has been verifed by a securities dealer in accordance with the Regulations in respect of: the sale of the mutual funds for which the account has been opened, or a transaction that is part of a series of transactions that includes that sale; and an account that is opened at the request of an entity for the deposit, by a life insurance company afliated with that entity, of a death beneft under a life insurance policy or annuity where: the account is opened in the name of a benefciary that is a person; only the death beneft may be deposited in the account, and; the policy or annuity contract, under which the death beneft claim was made, has been in existence for at least two years before the death beneft claim was made. 

### Other activities exempted from client identifcation requirements 

You do not have to verify the identity of persons and entities, as listed in this guidance, for the following:Footnote 45

the opening of an account established pursuant to the escrow requirements of a Canadian securities regulator or Canadian stock exchange or any provincial legislation; the opening of an account where the account holder or settlor is a pension fund that is regulated under federal or provincial legislation; the opening of an account in the name of, or in respect of which instructions are authorized to be given by an FE, a securities dealer, a life insurance company, or an investment fund that is regulated under provincial securities legislation; and the opening of an account solely to provide customer accounting services to a securities dealer. 

These exceptions do not apply to large cash transactions, large VC transactions, or suspicious transactions. 

### Group Plans 

If you open a group plan account, other than those for which exceptions already apply, you do not have to verify the identity of the individual members of the plan if: 

the identity of the entity that is the plan sponsor has been verifed; and the individual member contributions are made by the sponsor of the plan or by payroll deduction. 

# Third party determination requirements : FINTRAC's compliance guidance 

This guidance explains the third party determination requirements under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (the Act) and associated Regulations. 

## 2. Who is a third party and how to make a determination 

A third party is the person or entity that instructs another person or entity to conduct a transaction or activity on their behalf. As such, the third party is the instructing party to the transaction or activity, and is also understood to be the party that the transaction occurs on behalf of (the “on behalf of” party). 

Note: The Financial Action Task Force, the Egmont Group and other anti-money laundering and anti- terrorist fnancing authoritative bodies have observed that third parties have been used in several money laundering and terrorist fnancing cases. It is not uncommon for criminals to use third parties as a method to evade detection by distancing themselves from the proceeds of crime. 

You must take reasonable measures to determine whether a third party is involved when you carry out certain transactions or activities, as explained in this guidance. 

Reasonable measures for third party determination could include asking the client if they are acting at the instruction of another person or entity, or asking whether another person or entity will be instructing on the account. The steps you take as reasonable measures to make a third party determination must be documented in your compliance program’s policies and procedures. 

## 3. When to make a determination 

You must take reasonable measures to make a third party determination when you are required to: report a large cash transaction or keep a large cash transaction record report a large virtual currency transaction or keep a large virtual currency transaction record keep a signature card or an account operating agreement keep an information record, or submit a Casino Disbursement Report 

You must also provide information in an electronic funds transfer report ( casinos, money services businesses, foreign money services businesses, and fnancial entities only) for any person or entity on whose behalf an electronic funds transfer is requested or received. 

### Large Cash Transaction Report or large cash transaction record 

When you receive cash in an amount of $10,000 or more, and are required to submit a Large Cash Transaction Report to FINTRAC or to keep a large cash transaction record, you must take reasonable measures to determine whether the person from whom you receive the cash is acting on behalf of a third party. 

This is the case even if you receive cash from an armoured car. 

Note: This requirement applies to the 24-hour rule. 

### Large Virtual Currency Transaction Report or large virtual currency transaction record 

When you receive an amount of virtual currency equivalent to $10,000 or more, and are required to submit a Large Virtual Currency Transaction Report to FINTRAC or to keep a large virtual currency transaction record, you must take reasonable measures to determine whether the person from whom you receive the virtual currency is acting on behalf of a third party. 

Note: This requirement applies to the 24-hour rule. 

### Signature card or account operating agreement 

As a fnancial entity, a securities dealer or a casino, you must take reasonable measures to determine whether an account will be used by or on behalf of a third party, when you open an account and are required to keep a signature card or an account operating agreement. 

When you open a credit card account or a prepaid payment product account, you do not need to make a third party determination because you are not required to keep a signature card or an account operating agreement for these account types. 

### Information record 

If you are required to keep an information record for certain transactions or activities, you must take reasonable measures to determine whether the person or entity for which the information record is kept on, is acting on behalf of a third party. This must be done at the time you create the information record. 

This requirement applies to the following sectors: 

money services business foreign money services business an agent of the Crown life insurance company broker or agent mortgage administrator, broker or lender real estate developer, broker or sales representative, 

### Casino Disbursement Report 

As a casino, when you are required to report a disbursement of $10,000 or more, you must take reasonable measures, at the time of the disbursement, to determine whether: 

the requester of the casino disbursement is acting on behalf of a third party 

Note: This requirement applies to the 24-hour rule. 

## 4. What measures to take 

If you determine that there is a third party involved, you must take reasonable measures to obtain the following information about the third party: 

If the third party is a person—their name, address, telephone number (not required if the third party determination is made for a large cash transaction or large virtual currency transaction), date of birth and occupation, or in the case of a sole proprietor, the nature of their principal business 

If the third party is a corporation or an other entity—its name, address, telephone number (not required if the third party determination is made for a large cash transaction or large virtual currency transaction), the nature of its principal business, its registration or incorporation number and the jurisdiction (province or state) and country of issue of that number, and 

the relationship between the third party and the following person or entity, as applicable: 

the person who conducts the large cash transaction the person who conducts the large virtual currency transaction the account holder(s) 

the person or entity that the information record is kept on, or the person or entity that requests the casino disbursement. 

The relationship between the person or entity and the third party can be for example, an accountant, broker, customer, employee, friend or relative. 

A record must be kept of the information obtained. 

If you receive cash or virtual currency from an armoured car on behalf of another party (such as your client), you must obtain and keep a record of the information detailed above at the time the cash or virtual currency is received. 

Retention: At least 5 years from the date the third party determination record was created 

## 5. What if I am not able to make a determination, but I suspect that a third party is involved 

If you are not able to make a third party determination, but have reasonable grounds to suspect that a third party is involved, you must keep a record that: 

describes the reason(s) why you suspect that the person or entity is acting on behalf of a third party, and 

as applicable, your record must also indicate: 

When you receive cash in an amount of $10,000 or more, and are required to submit a Large Cash Transaction Report to FINTRAC or to keep a large cash transaction record—whether according to the person who gave you the cash, they are acting on their own behalf only When you receive an amount of virtual currency equivalent to $10,000 or more, and are required to submit a Large Virtual Currency Transaction Report to FINTRAC or to keep a large virtual currency transaction record—whether according to the person from whom you received the virtual currency, they are acting on their own behalf only 

When you open an account and are required to keep a signature card or an account operating agreement— whether according to a person who is authorized to act in respect of the account, the account will only be used by or on behalf of an account holder 

When you create an information record—whether, according to the person or entity for which the information record is kept, they are acting on their own behalf only, and When you are required to report a casino disbursement of $10,000 or more— whether, according to the person or entity that makes the request for the disbursement, they are acting on their own behalf only. 

Retention: At least 5 years from the date the record was created. 

## 6. What are the exceptions to making a third party determination 

As a fnancial entity, you do not need to make a third party determination when you open an account and are required to keep a signature card or an account operating agreement, if the account is for the processing of payments by credit card or prepaid payment product for a merchant. 

If you are a fnancial entity, securities dealer or casino, you do not need to make a third party determination when you open an account and are required to keep a signature card or an account operating agreement, if every account holder is a fnancial entity or a securities dealer that is engaged in the business of dealing in securities in Canada. 

If you are a life insurance company, broker or agent, you do not need to make a third party determination when you keep an information record on a benefciary in connection with the sale of a life insurance policy under which you are to remit an amount of $10,000 or more to the benefciary over the duration of the policy, regardless of the means of payment. 

## 7. What are the exceptions to keeping a record of a third party determination 

If you are a fnancial entity, a securities dealer or a casino, you do not have to take reasonable measures to obtain information and keep a record of that information for a third party determination if an account is opened by a legal counsel, an accountant or a real estate broker or sales representative, and you have reasonable grounds to believe that the account is to be used only for clients of the legal counsel, accountant or real estate broker or sales representative, as the case may be. 

If you are a securities dealer, you do not have to take reasonable measures to obtain information and keep a record of that information for a third party determination when an account operating agreement is kept for the account of a person or entity that is engaged in the business of dealing in securities only outside of Canada, and when: 

the account is in a country that is a member of the Financial Action Task Force the account is in a country that is not a member of the Financial Action Task Force but has implemented the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force relating to client identifcation and, at the time that the account is opened, the securities dealer has obtained written assurance from the account holder that the country has implemented those recommendations, or 

the account is in a country that is not a member of the Financial Action Task Force and has not implemented the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force relating to client identifcation but, at the time that the account is opened, the securities dealer has verifed the identity of all third parties in accordance with the methods to verify the identity of persons and entities under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations. 

# Benefcial ownership requirements 

## Overview 

This guidance came into force on June 1, 2021. 

Benefcial ownership requirements under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and associated Regulations apply to all reporting entities (REs). 

The concealment of benefcial ownership information is a technique used in money laundering and terrorist activity fnancing schemes. Identifying benefcial ownership removes the anonymity of the individuals behind the transactions and account activities, which is a key component of Canada's anti- money laundering and anti-terrorist fnancing regime. By collecting benefcial ownership information and confrming its accuracy, REs are performing an important step to mitigate the risk of money laundering and terrorist activity fnancing, and ultimately, to protect the integrity of Canada's fnancial system. 

## 1. Who are benefcial owners? 

Benefcial owners are the individuals who directly or indirectly own or control 25% or more of a corporation or an entity other than a corporation. In the case of a trust, they are the trustees, the known benefciaries and the settlors of the trust. If the trust is a widely held trust or a publicly traded trust, they are the trustees and all persons who own or control, directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the units of the trust. 

Benefcial owners cannot be other corporations, trusts or other entities. They must be the individuals who are the owners or controllers of the entity. It is important to consider and review the names found on ofcial documentation in order to confrm the accuracy of the benefcial ownership information. It may be necessary to search through many layers of information in order to confrm who are the benefcial owners, as the names found on ofcial documentation may not always refect the actual benefcial owners. 

## 2. When must I obtain benefcial ownership information? 

You must obtain benefcial ownership information when you verify the identity of an entity in accordance with the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations (PCMLTFR).Footnote 2 For more information about when you are required to verify the identity of entities, see your sector's guidance on When to identify persons and entities. 

The benefcial ownership information that you must obtain varies depending on whether the entity is a corporation, an entity other than a corporation (such as a partnership), a trust, or a widely held or publicly traded trust. The specifc benefcial ownership information that you must obtain for each type of entity is detailed in section " 5. What benefcial ownership information do I need to obtain and confrm the accuracy of?". 

## 3. When must I confrm the accuracy of benefcial ownership information? 

You must take reasonable measures to confrm the accuracy of the benefcial ownership information when you frst obtain it and in the course of conducting ongoing monitoring of your business relationships. 

## 4. Are there circumstances where I do not have to obtain benefcial ownership information and confrm its accuracy? 

You do not have to obtain benefcial ownership information and take reasonable measures to confrm its accuracy in the following situations: 

* 1. For a group plan account held within a dividend or a distribution reinvestment plan. This includes plans that permits purchases of additional shares or units by the member with contributions other than the dividends or distributions paid by the plan sponsor, if the sponsor is an entity: whose shares or units are traded on a Canadian stock exchange; and that operates in a country that is a member of the Financial Action Task Force.
* 2. If you are a fnancial entity, benefcial ownership requirements do not apply to your activities in respect of the processing of payments by credit card or prepaid payment product for a merchant.Footnote 5
* 3. If you are a life insurance company, broker or agent, and you deal in reinsurance, benefcial ownership requirements do not apply to you for those dealings.Footnote 6

The benefcial ownership requirements do not apply if you are not required to verify the identity of an entity under the Regulations because of a related exception. This is because your obligation to verify identity for a particular transaction, activity, or client does not apply in that circumstance. 

## 5. What benefcial ownership information do I need to obtain and confrm the accuracy of? 

When you verify an entity's identity in accordance with the PCMLTFR, you must obtain the following information about benefcial owners:Footnote 7 

### Corporations 

the names of all directors of the corporation and the names and addresses of all persons who directly or indirectly own or control 25% or more of the shares of the corporation. 

### Trusts 

the names and addresses of all trustees and all known benefciaries and settlors of the trust. 

### Widely held or publicly traded trusts 

the names of all trustees of the trust and the names and addresses of all persons who directly or indirectly own or control 25% or more of the units of the trust. 

### Entities other than corporations or trusts 

the names and addresses of all persons who directly or indirectly own or control 25% or more of the entity. 

In all cases, you must obtain information establishing the ownership, control and structure of the entity.Footnote 8 

You must also take reasonable measures to confrm the accuracy of the information when you frst obtain it and in the course of the ongoing monitoring of your business relationships.Footnote 9 

If you verify the identity of a not-for-proft organization, you must also determine if the entity is:Footnote 10 

a charity registered with the Canada Revenue Agency under the Income Tax Act; or an organization, other than one referred to above, that solicits charitable donations from the public. 

## 6. How do I obtain the required benefcial ownership information? 

To obtain benefcial ownership information, which includes information on the ownership, control and structure, you could have the entity provide it, either verbally or in writing, or you could search for publicly available information. 

For example: 

the entity can provide you with ofcial documentation; the entity can tell you the benefcial ownership information and you can write it down for record keeping purposes; or 

the entity can fll out a document to provide you with the information. 

## 7. How do I confrm the accuracy of benefcial ownership information? 

You must take reasonable measures to confrm the accuracy of the benefcial ownership information that you obtain.Footnote 11 These reasonable measures cannot be the same as the measures you used to obtain the information. 

Your reasonable measures could include referring to ofcial documentation or records. For example, for a corporation or other entity, you could refer to records such as, but not limited to, the: 

minute book; securities register; shareholders register; articles of incorporation; annual returns; certifcate of corporate status; shareholder agreements; partnership agreements; or board of directors' meeting records of decisions. 

It is also acceptable to have a client sign a document to confrm the accuracy of the benefcial ownership information you obtained, which includes information on ownership, control and structure. In this case, it is possible for one document to be used to satisfy the two steps—namely to obtain the information and to confrm its accuracy by means of the signature. 

In the case of a trust, you could confrm the accuracy of the information by reviewing the trust deed, which should provide you with the information needed. 

Other reasonable measures can include: 

asking the client to provide supporting ofcial documentation; conducting an open-source search; or consulting commercially available information. 

As a best practice, you should also confrm whether a not-for-proft organization is a charity registered with the Canada Revenue Agency by consulting the charities listing on the Canada Revenue Agency website. 

The reasonable measures that you take to confrm the accuracy of benefcial ownership information, which includes ownership, control, and structure information, must align with your risk assessment of the entity's risk for money laundering or terrorist activity fnancing offences. The reasonable measures you take with entities assessed to pose a high risk must go further to help you understand and confrm the benefcial ownership, as well as establish the overall ownership, control, and structure of that entity. 

The reasonable measures that you take with entities that have a complex business structures must go further to ensure that you are able to understand and confrm the accuracy of benefcial ownership, which includes establishing the ownership, control and structure of that entity. This does not mean, however, that you need to consider or treat a complex entity as posing a high risk. You need to choose reasonable measures that are appropriate to the situation. 

## 8. What if I cannot obtain benefcial ownership information or confrm its accuracy? 

If you are unable to obtain the benefcial ownership information, to keep it up to date in the course of the ongoing monitoring of business relationships, or to confrm its accuracy, when it is frst obtained, or during the course of ongoing monitoring then you must:Footnote 12 

take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the entity's chief executive ofcer or of the person who performs that function; and apply the special measures for high-risk clients, including enhanced ongoing monitoring. 

For more information on enhanced ongoing monitoring, see FINTRAC's Ongoing monitoring requirements guidance. 

## 9. How do I verify the identity of an entity's chief executive ofcer or of the person who performs that function? 

The PCMLTFR does not require that you verify the identity of the chief executive ofcer or of the person who performs that function in accordance with the prescribed methods. However, you could use one of the methods outlined in the Methods to verify the identity of persons and entities guidance to meet this obligation. 

Additionally, there is no record keeping obligation if you have identifed the chief executive ofcer or a person who performs that function using the prescribed methods to verify identity. However, during a FINTRAC examination, you could be asked to demonstrate the reasonable measures that you took to identify the chief executive ofcer or person who performs that function. 

## 10. What if there are no benefcial owners? 

You may obtain information confrming that there is no individual who directly or indirectly owns or controls 25% or more of a corporation, a widely held or publicly traded trust, or an entity other than a corporation or trust. This is not the same thing as being unable to obtain the benefcial ownership information. 

If you determine that there is no individual who directly or indirectly owns or controls 25% or more of a corporation, a widely held or publicly traded trust, or an entity other than a corporation or trust, you must keep a record of the measures you took and the information you obtained in order to reach that conclusion.Footnote 13 However, you are still required to obtain and take reasonable measures to confrm information about the ownership, control and structure of the entity. 

## 11. What benefcial ownership records do I need to keep? 

You must keep a record of the benefcial ownership information you obtain and of the measures you take to confrm the accuracy of the information. 

The measures that you take to confrm benefcial ownership information can be part of your overall policies and procedures, so a separate record may not be needed. You only need to keep an individual record of the specifc measures you take to confrm the accuracy of benefcial ownership information in situations where the measures differ from those that are documented in your policies and procedures. 

For a corporation, you must record: 

the names of all directors of the corporation; the names and addresses of all persons who directly or indirectly own or control 25% or more of the shares of the corporation; and 

information establishing the ownership, control and structure of the corporation. 

For a trust, you must record: 

the names and addresses of all trustees, known benefciaries and known settlors of the trust; and information establishing the ownership, control and structure of the trust. 

For a widely held or publicly traded trust, you must record: 

the names of all trustees of the trust; the names and addresses of all persons who directly or indirectly own or control 25% or more of the units of the trust; and 

information establishing the ownership, control and structure of the trust. 

For an entity other than a corporation or trust, you must record: 

the names and addresses of all persons who directly or indirectly own or control 25% or more of the entity; and 

information establishing the ownership, control and structure of the entity. 

If you verify the identity of a not-for-proft organization, you must also keep a record that indicates whether the entity is: 

a charity registered with the Canada Revenue Agency under the Income Tax Act; or an organization, other than a registered charity, that solicits charitable donations from the public. 

In situations where no individual directly or indirectly owns or controls 25% or more of a corporation, a widely held or publicly traded trust, or an entity other than a corporation or trust, you must keep a record of the measures you took to confrm the accuracy of the information, as well as the information you obtained in order to reach that conclusion. The date you took the measures should also be included as a best practice. 

Retention: You must keep these records for at least fve years from the day the last business transaction is conducted. 

# Business relationship requirements : FINTRAC's compliance guidance 

From: Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) 

This guidance explains when reporting entities enter into a business relationship with a client and related obligations under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (the Act) and associated Regulations. 

## 1. Who must comply 

This guidance applies to all reporting entities, however, some requirements and examples may only apply to certain reporting entities. 

If you are a life insurance company, or an entity that is a broker or agent, that offers loans or prepaid payment products to the public, or maintains accounts related to these products, other than the excluded types in the Regulations, then you are considered a fnancial entity for those activities and you can fnd your business relationship obligations as a fnancial entity in the guidance below. 

## 2. What is a business relationship 

A business relationship is a relationship established between a reporting entity and a client to conduct fnancial transactions or provide services related to fnancial transactions. 

## 3. When do I enter into a business relationship with a client 

When you enter into a business relationship varies by reporting entity sector, and depends on the activities and transactions that a client conducts with you. For more information on when you enter into a business relationship with a client, see your sector-specifc obligations below.

### Money services businesses and foreign money services businesses 

You enter into a business relationship with a client: 

the second time you are required to verify their identity within a 5-year period, or when you enter into a service agreement with an entity (the entity must be in Canada if you are a Foreign Money Services Business) 

## 4. Circumstances where a business relationship is not created 

### Financial entities, securities dealers, and casinos 

You do not enter into a business relationship when opening an account, for the following circumstances, when you: 

open a business account, if you have already verifed the identity of at least 3 persons authorized to give instructions for the account 

open a second account for a person who already has an account with you 

open an account at the request of an entity, for a life insurance company afliated with the entity to deposit a death beneft under a life insurance policy or annuity, if: 

the account is opened in the name of a benefciary that is a person only that death beneft may be deposited into the account, and the policy or annuity contract under which the claim for the death beneft is made has been in existence for a period of at least 2 years before the day on which the claim is made 

open an account for the sale of mutual funds if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the client’s identity has been verifed by a securities dealer in respect of: 

the sale of the mutual funds for which the account was opened, or a transaction that is part of a series of transactions that includes that sale 

sell an exempt policy as defned in subsection 306(1) of the Income Tax Regulations

open an account solely in the course of providing accounting services to a securities dealer, and open an account, if you are a fnancial entity or securities dealer that is not required to verify the identity of, or to keep a signature card for a person who is a member of a group plan account if: 

the member’s contributions are made by the sponsor of the plan or by means of payroll deductions, and 

the identity of the plan sponsor has been verifed 

### All reporting entity sectors 

You do not enter into a business relationship that would otherwise have been formed after the frst or second time you are required to verify identity (as applicable to your reporting entity sector), if you are not required to verify the identity of a client under the Regulations because of a related exception. This is because your obligation to verify identity for a particular transaction, activity, or client does not apply in that circumstance. For example, if your requirement to verify identity does not apply because your client is a public body, a very large corporation, or a subsidiary of either of those, whose fnancial statements are consolidated, then a business relationship would not be formed. 

However, a business relationship would be formed in instances where you have the obligation to verify identity, but the Regulations allow you to not do so for a particular reason. This is because the underlying obligation to verify a client’s identity still exists, even if you relied upon the applicable reasoning for not verifying identity. This could occur as the result of a suspicious transaction or attempted transaction, or as the result of not having to re-verify the identity of a client. 

#### Suspicious transaction reporting: 

When you are required to report a Suspicious Transaction Report to FINTRAC, you are required to take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the person or entity that conducts or attempts to conduct the transaction. Despite whether your reasonable measures are unsuccessful, or if you believe taking reasonable measures would inform the person or entity that you are fling a Suspicious Transaction Report, this transaction must factor into your business relationship requirements, as either the frst or second time you are required to verify the identity of a client. 

#### Re-verifying identity: 

Your business relationship requirements must still factor in a transaction or activity for which you have the requirement to verify identity but choose not to because the Regulations allow it. The Regulations allow you to choose not to re-verify the identity of a client if: 

you previously did so using the methods specifed in the Regulations in place at the time you have kept the associated records, and you have no doubts about the information used 

## 5. When to determine if I have entered into a business relationship with a client 

You should determine that you have entered into a business relationship as soon as possible after opening an account or after verifying your client’s identity for either the frst or second transaction or activity (as applicable to your reporting entity sector) where you had the obligation to do so. As a best practice, you should make a business relationship determination within 30 calendar days of opening the account or of the frst or second transaction or activity (as applicable). 

## 6. Business relationship records to keep 

Once you enter into a business relationship with a client, you must keep a record of the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship. For sector-specifc examples of the purpose and intended nature of a business relationship, see Annex A. 

As a best practice, to help you meet your know your client requirements and conduct ongoing monitoring of your business relationships, this record should also: 

describe your business dealings with the client, and include information that would help you anticipate the types of transactions and activities that the client may conduct. You could then use this information to identify unusual or suspicious transactions while conducting your ongoing monitoring. 

If you already have a record of this information that is readily available in other records that you are required to keep, you are not required to keep an additional record. For example, for clients who already hold accounts, you may use the information found in the intended use of the account record, client credit fle, credit card account record or a service agreement to satisfy this obligation. 

Retention: You must keep these records for 5 years from the day they were created. 

## 7. When a business relationship ends 

### Account-based business relationships 

A business relationship ends 5 years after the day on which a client closes their last account with you. 

### Non-account-based business relationships 

A business relationship ends when a period of at least 5 years has passed since the day of the last transaction that required you to verify the identity of the client. 

# Ongoing monitoring requirements 

## Overview 

### 1. What is ongoing monitoring? 

Ongoing monitoring is a process that you must develop and use to review all the information you have obtained about the clients with whom you have a business relationship, in order to: 

detect any suspicious transactions that you are required to report to FINTRAC; keep client identifcation information, benefcial ownership information, and the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship record up to date; reassess the level of risk associated with your client's transactions and activities; and determine whether transactions or activities are consistent with the client information you obtained and your risk assessment of the client. 

For more information about when you enter into a business relationship with a client see FINTRAC's Business relationship requirements guidance. 

Your process for conducting ongoing monitoring could include the monitoring of an individual client or of groups of clients. References to the ongoing monitoring of a client in this guidance refers to both an individual client and groups of clients, depending on your processes. 

### 2. When must I conduct ongoing monitoring? 

When you enter into a business relationship with a client you must periodically conduct ongoing monitoring of that business relationship, based on your risk assessment.Footnote 2 

The frequency at which you conduct ongoing monitoring will depend on the risk level assigned to clients in your risk assessment. For example, clients identifed as posing a low risk may require less frequent ongoing monitoring whereas those in your high-risk category will require that you take enhanced measures. For more information on risk assessment requirements and enhanced measures, see FINTRAC's Compliance program requirements guidance. 

FINTRAC expects that your policies and procedures will include the frequency at which you will conduct ongoing monitoring of your clients, based on your risk assessment for a client or group of clients. 

### 3. When must I conduct enhanced ongoing monitoring? 

You must take enhanced measures and conduct enhanced ongoing monitoring of a client that you have identifed as posing a high risk in your risk assessment. This means that you must take extra measures in addition to what is required, as appropriate for the level of client risk.Footnote 3 

You could consider the following methods to conduct enhanced ongoing monitoring of your high-risk clients: 

reviewing transactions based on an approved schedule that involves management sign-off; developing reports and reviewing these reports of high-risk transactions more frequently; fagging certain activities or those that deviate from your expectations and raise concerns, as necessary; 

setting business limits or parameters on accounts or transactions that would trigger early warning signals and require a mandatory review; or reviewing transactions more frequently against suspicious transaction indicators relevant to business relationships. 

### 4. What are the exceptions to ongoing monitoring? 

You do not have to conduct ongoing monitoring in the following situations: 

* 1. Financial entities:You do not have toconduct ongoing monitoring for a group plan account held within a dividend or a distribution reinvestment plan (including a plan that allows members to purchase additional shares or units with contributions other than the dividends or distributions paid by the sponsor of the plan), if the sponsor of the plan:Footnote 4 is an entity whose shares or units are traded on a Canadian stock exchange; and operates in a country that is a member of the Financial Action Task Force.
* 2. Insurance companies, brokers or agents:You do not have to conduct ongoing monitoring when you are dealing in reinsurance.Footnote 5
### 5. What records do I need to keep for ongoing monitoring? 

You must keep records of the measures you take and of the information obtained from the ongoing monitoring of your clients with whom you have a business relationship.Footnote 6 This includes: 

your processes in place to perform ongoing monitoring; your processes in place to perform the enhanced ongoing monitoring of high-risk clients; your processes for recording the information obtained as a result of your ongoing monitoring; your processes for recording the information obtained as a result of your enhanced ongoing monitoring of high-risk clients; and the information obtained as a result of your ongoing monitoring and enhanced ongoing monitoring of high-risk clients. 

You must outline the measures you use to conduct the ongoing monitoring of your business relationships in your policies and procedures, which can form part of your ongoing monitoring records. However, the information you obtain as a result of your ongoing monitoring is likely to be specifc to a particular business relationship and not captured in your policies and procedures, so it should be documented separately. You can document and update the information you obtain through your ongoing monitoring activities across several records. For example, updates to the client identifcation, benefcial ownership or business relationship information you have, could be recorded in any fle you maintain on a client. 

Retention: You must keep a record of the ongoing monitoring measures taken and the information obtained from that ongoing monitoring for at least fve years from the date the record was created.Footnote 7 

### 6. When does the requirement for ongoing monitoring end? 

You are no longer required to conduct ongoing monitoring when your business relationship with a client ends. For more information about when a business relationship ends, see FINTRAC's Business relationship requirements guidance. 

### 7. When does the requirement for enhanced ongoing monitoring end? 

You are no longer required to conduct enhanced ongoing monitoring when your business relationship ends or when, based on your risk assessment, you no longer consider a client to pose a high risk. When you no longer consider a client high-risk, you are still required to conduct ongoing monitoring of the client at the frequency determined by the client's new risk rating. For more information about when a business relationship ends, see FINTRAC's Business relationship requirements guidance. 

# Politically exposed persons and heads of international organizations guidance 

All reporting entities (REs) have politically exposed persons (PEPs) and heads of international organizations (HIOs) requirements under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and associated Regulations. However, some requirements and the examples given in this guidance may only apply to certain REs. 

References to PEPs in this guidance include both foreign and domestic PEPs, unless otherwise specifed. 

The access, infuence and control that PEPs and HIOs have can make them vulnerable to corruption and the potential targets of criminals who could exploit their status and use them, knowingly or unknowingly, to carry out money laundering (ML) or terrorist activity fnancing (TF) offences.Footnote 1 The family members and close associates of PEPs and HIOs are potential targets as well because they can more easily avoid detection. 

This guidance explains your obligations under the PCMLTFA and associated Regulations in relation to determining who are PEPs, HIOs, and persons related or closely associated to them. It also provides clarity on related terminology and considerations. 

## 1. Who is a domestic PEP? 

A domestic PEP is a person who currently holds, or has held within the last 5 years, a specifc ofce or position in or on behalf of the Canadian federal government, a Canadian provincial (or territorial) government, or a Canadian municipal government. Specifcally, the person has held the ofce or position of:Footnote 2 

Governor General, lieutenant governor or head of government; member of the Senate or House of Commons or member of a legislature; deputy minister or equivalent rank; ambassador, or attaché or counsellor of an ambassador; military ofcer with a rank of general or above; president of a corporation that is wholly owned directly by His Majesty in right of Canada or a province; 

head of a government agency; judge of an appellate court in a province, the Federal Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada; 

leader or president of a political party represented in a legislature; or mayor, reeve or other similar chief ofcer of a municipal or local government\*\*. 

\*\*Note: In line with legislation across Canada, municipal governments include cities, towns, villages and rural (county) or metropolitan municipalities. As such, a mayor is the head of a city, town, village and rural or metropolitan municipality, regardless of the size of the population. 

A person ceases to be a domestic PEP 5 years after they have left ofce or 5 years after they are deceased.Footnote 3 You must continue to mitigate the risks associated with domestic PEPs until they cease to be domestic PEPs. 

## 2. Who is a foreign PEP? 

A foreign PEP is a person who holds or has held one of the following ofces or positions in or on behalf of a foreign state:Footnote 4 

head of state or head of government; member of the executive council of government or member of a legislature; deputy minister or equivalent rank; ambassador, or attaché or counsellor of an ambassador; military ofcer with a rank of general or above; president of a state-owned company or a state-owned bank; head of a government agency; judge of a supreme court, constitutional court or other court of last resort; or leader or president of a political party represented in a legislature. 

These persons are foreign PEPs regardless of citizenship, residence status or birthplace. 

Once you determine that a person is a foreign PEP, they remain a foreign PEP forever(including deceased foreign PEPs). You are not required to determine whether they are a foreign PEP again.Footnote 5 

## 3. Who is a HIO? 

A HIO is a person who currently holds or has held within the last 5 years the specifc ofce or position of head of an international organization and the international organization that they head or were head of is either:Footnote 6 

* 1. an international organization established by the governments of states;
* 2. an institution of an organization referred to in 1 above; or
* 3. an international sports organization.

An institution established by an international organization does not have to operate internationally and it is possible that an institution only operates domestically, or in one jurisdiction. 

The HIO is the primary person who leads the organization. For example, the HIO could be a president or CEO. 

A person ceases to be a HIO 5 years after they are no longer the head of the organization or institution or 5 years after they are deceased.Footnote 7 You must continue to mitigate the risks associated with 4. What is an international organization? 

To determine whether a person is a HIO, you must frst determine whether you are dealing with an international organization. An international organization is set up by the governments of more than one member country, has activities in several countries, and is bound by a formal agreement among member countries. An international organization has its own legal status, and it is an entity that is distinct from the member countries. 

Looking at how an organization was established will help you to determine if it is an international organization. For example, if the organization was established by a formally signed agreement between the governments of more than one country, then it is likely an international organization, and the head of that organization is a HIO. 

International organizations are recognized by their member countries, but they are not resident organizations of any country. For examples of international organizations and institutions established by international organizations, see Annex 1. 

### 5. Who is a family member of a PEP or HIO? 

If a person is a PEP or HIO, some of their family members are considered family members of PEPs or HIOs under the PCMLTFA and associated Regulations. These family members are:Footnote 8 

their spouse or common-law partner; their biological or adoptive child(ren); their mother(s) or father(s); the mother(s) or father(s) of their spouse or common-law partner (mother-in-law or father-in-law); and 

the child(ren) of their mother or father (sibling(s)). 

Once you determine that a person is a family member of a foreign PEP (including a deceased foreign PEP), they remain a family member of a foreign PEP forever and you are not required to make this determination again.Footnote 9 

Once you determine that a person is a family member of a domestic PEP or HIO, they remain a family member of a domestic PEP or HIO until fve years after the domestic PEP or HIO has left ofce.Footnote 10 In the case of a deceased domestic PEP or HIO, persons that are their family members remain a family member of a domestic PEP or HIO for fve years after the domestic PEP or HIO ceases to be a domestic PEP or HIO. So, you must continue to mitigate the risks associated with the family members of domestic PEPs or HIOs during that time. 

Is a PEP or HIO's ex-spouse or partner considered a family member? 

An ex-spouse or partner may continue to have access to a PEP or HIO's funds even when a divorce has taken place or a relationship has ended. Therefore, in the case of: 

the ex-spouse or partner of a foreign PEP, they are considered a family member of a foreign PEP forever; and 

the ex-spouse or partner of a domestic PEP or HIO, they are considered a family member of a domestic PEP or HIO until the domestic PEP or HIO ceases to be a domestic PEP or HIO. 

Is a PEP or HIO's stepchild or step-sibling considered a family member? 

A step family relationship does not fall under the defnition of a family member unless a child is legally adopted. For example, if Helen is a domestic PEP, and she has legally adopted her stepdaughter, then her stepdaughter is her child under the law and is considered to be the family member of a domestic PEP. 

Similarly, if a marriage includes step-siblings, these step-siblings are not considered family members if they are not legally adopted by the stepparent. However, you may want to consider the step family members as close associates of the PEP or HIO, depending on their relationship. 

Is the niece or nephew of a PEP or HIO considered a family member? 

No. Only the family members of a PEP or HIO listed in this guidance must be regarded as family members of PEPs or HIOs. For example, if John is a PEP, then John's brother, Sam, is considered a family member of a PEP, however, Sam's daughter (John's niece) is not considered a family member of a PEP. However, you may want to consider extended family members as close associates of the PEP or HIO, depending on their relationship. 

### 6. Who is considered a close associate of a PEP or a HIO? 

A close associate can be a person who is connected to a PEP or HIO for personal or business reasons. Examples of relationships that could indicate that someone is a close associate (personal or business) could include, but are not limited to, persons who: 

are the business partners of, or who benefcially own or control a business with, a PEP or HIO; are in a romantic relationship with a PEP or HIO; are involved in fnancial transactions with a PEP or a HIO; serve as prominent members of the same political party or union as a PEP or HIO; serve as a member of the same board as a PEP or HIO; carry out charitable works closely with a PEP or HIO; or are listed as joint on a policy where one of the holders may be a PEP or HIO. 

Once you determine that a person is the close associate of a PEP or HIO, they remain a close associate until they lose that connection. 

### 7. What does it mean to "detect a fact" about a PEP or HIO? 

Detecting a fact about a PEP or HIO is to discover (proactively or not) information about a person that could lead you to make a PEP or HIO determination or to update information about a known PEP or HIO. You detect a fact when you discover PEP or HIO related information about a person that has an account- based business relationship or a non-account-based business relationship with you, outside of your periodic review of existing clients. The information that you detect must be a fact that constitutes reasonable grounds to suspect that a person is a PEP, HIO, or family member or close associate of a PEP or HIO. 

There is no requirement for you to have proactive processes in place to detect facts about existing clients, but if you do detect information related to a PEP or HIO determination, then you must act on that information. For example, you might detect a fact that would require further action based on information obtained from an existing client, monitoring efforts you may already have in place, knowledge of domestic and world events, or a search run against an open source or third party database. 

While a name match is a fact, it is not necessarily a fact that constitutes reasonable grounds to suspect that an existing client is a PEP, HIO, or family member or close associate of a PEP or HIO. As a best practice, you could apply additional criteria (for example, address, date of birth, age, transaction activities, etc.) to a name match, to meet the reasonable grounds to suspect threshold. 

### 8. How do I establish the source of funds, source of virtual currency (VC), or source of a person's wealth? 

Once you have determined that a person is a PEP, HIO, or a family member or close associate of a PEP or HIO (in certain circumstances, as applicable), you must take reasonable measures to establish the source of the funds or source of VC used for a transaction or that is expected to be deposited into an account, and the source of a person's wealth. To do this you could take measures such as: 

asking the person; or referring to open source information available about the person. 

If a transaction or the account activity is inconsistent with the information you have about the source of funds or source of VC, or the source of the person's wealth, then you may want to follow up with the client for clarifcation. If the information remains inconsistent with what you know about the person, or you are not satisfed with their response and have reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction or deposit is related to the commission or the attempted commission of an ML or TF offence, you must fle a suspicious transaction report. 

### 9. Who can review a transaction or allow an account to stay open? 

A member of senior management must review transactions and allow certain accounts to stay open. A member of senior management is a person who has: 

the authority to make management decisions about transactions or accounts and is accountable for them; 

awareness of the ML or TF risks to which you are exposed; and awareness and understanding of your obligations related to PEPs, HIOs, and their family members and close associates. 

If you are a sole proprietor with no employees, agents or other persons authorized to act on your behalf, you are considered to be the senior manager. 

### 10. Should I treat a PEP or HIO as a high-risk client? 

You must treat all persons that you determine to be foreign PEPs or family members or close associates of foreign PEPs as posing a high risk. 

Persons that you determine to be domestic PEPs, HIOs, or family members or close associates of domestic PEPs or HIOs must, be treated as high-risk if you consider, based on your risk assessment, that there is a high-risk of an ML or TF offence being committed. 

Once you determine that there is a high risk of an ML or TF offence being committed, you must take the measures prescribed in the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Regulations. These measures should be detailed in your written compliance policies and procedures for high-risk clients. For more information about risk assessment considerations for PEPs or HIOs see FINTRAC's Risk assessment guidance.
